Here is a simple guideline.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bf2fa2ad00661196.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"What makes you unique?" How to answer this interview question</span></p></a><li><strong>Communicate as early as possible</strong> – Do not wait until the eleventh hour to tell your boss that you are not coming in for work. When you feel unwell, such that you cannot go to work, text your boss so that he or she has adequate time to make necessary arrangements.</li><li><strong>Communicate to your boss directly</strong> – It is improper to send a text to a colleague who will inform your boss that you are not coming to work. Instead, be bold and text the boss directly.</li><li><strong>Keep it short</strong> – Avoid a long text message that might contain unnecessary details. It is tedious to read long texts, and thus, your boss might ignore it considering that they may be busy with other duties.</li><li><strong>Be precise</strong> – Go straight to the point and do not be vague. Let your boss know your intentions within the first few sentences of the text.</li><li><strong>Avoid unnecessary extra details</strong> – Do not go into the specific details of your sickness. Tell your boss that you are unwell and will not come in.</li><li><strong>Have a plan or an alternative</strong> – Who else can perform the task you do at work? Always suggest to your boss a colleague who can handle your work when you are absent. Ensure that you seek the consent of your colleague before contacting your boss.</li><li><strong>Call if there is no response - </strong>Ideally, your boss should respond after receiving your text. However, if he or she does not reply after a short period, something might have gone wrong, and maybe your text was not delivered. Call your boss to confirm if your sick off request has been approved.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fb0588db1d901745.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best love messages for her from the heart</span></p></a><h2>Not feeling well message to your boss</h2><p class=align-left>What can I text my boss when I’m sick?
