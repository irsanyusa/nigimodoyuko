Her path to&nbsp;fame was not easy, nor was her path to&nbsp;self-acceptance.</p><p>The actress’s height is&nbsp;impressive—191&nbsp;cm, and for many years it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;problem for her. In&nbsp;her <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a>, she was often mocked by&nbsp;classmates, and university teachers warned her that finding a&nbsp;job would be&nbsp;very difficult. But she was able to&nbsp;turn her unconventional appearance into an&nbsp;advantage, and now she confidently wears high heels and inspires everyone with her story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/21b/e88/03f8d65987b45f6f4e6a03656b.jpg><p>Can Nguyen/Capital Pictures/EAST NEWS</p><p>Gwendoline Christie attracts a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;attention on&nbsp;red carpets, and it’s not so&nbsp;much because she’s way taller than all of&nbsp;her colleagues, but because of&nbsp;her incredible <a href=# title=charisma data-link=tag>charisma</a>. The future star was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> on&nbsp;October&nbsp;28, 1978, in&nbsp;the English town of&nbsp;Worthing, and she grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;village near South Downs. Her mother was a&nbsp;housewife, and her father worked in&nbsp;sales and marketing. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, Gwendoline loved dancing and was professionally <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>involved</a> in&nbsp;gymnastics, which she had to&nbsp;quit due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;back injury.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager, she loved watching foreign films, reading fashion magazines, and was interested in&nbsp;the acting profession. By&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;14, her height was already over 180&nbsp;cm. All of&nbsp;this made Gwendoline stand out from her peers, and as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, they did not accept her.</p><p>Years later, the actress looks at&nbsp;this philosophically. Talking about her outstanding height seems to&nbsp;bore her, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;constant questions about criticism, “I&nbsp;really don’t want to&nbsp;talk about mocking, I’m more interested in&nbsp;how to&nbsp;overcome&nbsp;it.” Moreover, she claims that she was really lucky because she had a&nbsp;strong personality.</p><p>“There was something inside me&nbsp;that just decided, ‘Fine. If&nbsp;I’m outside the party, then I’m going to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;party of&nbsp;my&nbsp;own.’ Because what else was&nbsp;I going to&nbsp;do? If&nbsp;you’re shut on&nbsp;the outside, then you might as&nbsp;well enjoy yourself on&nbsp;the outside. Make the best of&nbsp;it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/108/c75/c41149500195905a27b50796b7.jpg><p>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;15, Gwendoline played the main role in&nbsp;the school play “Lady Macbeth” and realized, even despite her shyness, that she wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress. Her parents supported her, even though she didn’t expect them&nbsp;to.</p><p>Christie learned about the acting profession at&nbsp;Drama Centre London. Her teachers warned her that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;hard for her to&nbsp;find work with her appearance because she looked different from other actresses. And she was very shy about her appearance. But she remembers that Tilda Swinton, in&nbsp;<i>Orlando,</i> gave her confidence. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “I&nbsp;remember thinking, ’Well, she is&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;film, she is&nbsp;otherworldly.’ I&nbsp;realized that maybe there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;place for me&nbsp;too.”</p><p>When the future star was 24&nbsp;years old, she was noticed by&nbsp;photographer Polly Borland, who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>invited</a> her to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;model for her photo project. This work brought attention to&nbsp;Gwendoline and helped her to&nbsp;love her body and accept her femininity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a59/ca0/6c082a56fe8c885aee2750344e.jpg><p>James Shaw / Avalon/Photoshot/East News</p><p>Success in&nbsp;the film industry did not come right away. After getting her diploma, Gwendoline didn’t rush to&nbsp;pursue a&nbsp;career in&nbsp;film. She acted in&nbsp;theater, worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model, sang, worked as&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>assistant</a> for actor and writer Simon Callow, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>walked</a> his dogs. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, the actress admitted that she even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thought</a> of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;nun.</p><p>She received her first film roles relatively late, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;29. Her movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>debut</a> was in&nbsp;the little-known fantasy drama <i>The Time Surgeon</i>.&nbsp;4&nbsp;years later, she appeared in&nbsp;the television series <i>Wizards vs&nbsp;Aliens</i>. And finally, the true breakthrough in&nbsp;her career happened&nbsp;— the role of&nbsp;Brienne of&nbsp;Tarth in&nbsp;the series, <i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/670/d7d/e7834558fe9f6f5ec91dafe8c2.jpg><p>This role seemed to&nbsp;have been specifically written for Christie. The fans of&nbsp;George Martin’s novels the series was based on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discussed</a> online that this actress would be&nbsp;perfect for the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;tall, strong warrior. These discussions reached Gwendoline, and at&nbsp;the same time, someone even wrote directly to&nbsp;the actress’s agent, suggesting that she should audition for this role. So&nbsp;she started training and preparing for the role several months before casting even started. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;the casting directors saw her in&nbsp;character, nobody doubted that the role would go&nbsp;to&nbsp;her.</p><p>Gwendoline noted that after reading the book, she was impressed by&nbsp;Brienne. According to&nbsp;the actress, the fact that she also had to&nbsp;deal with mockery about her height and unconventional appearance made her feel a&nbsp;kinship with the character. To&nbsp;prepare for the role, the actress cut her long hair (which was the most difficult part for her), hired a&nbsp;boxing coach, learned fencing and horseback riding, and started wearing unisex clothing to&nbsp;change the way she walked and understand the character deeper.</p><p>The role of&nbsp;Brienne became her first full-fledged screen role, and she <a href=# title=got data-link=tag>got</a> it&nbsp;when she was 33. Later, she said that this character changed her life. But initially, Gwendoline did not have any illusions about the success of&nbsp;the series or&nbsp;her career, so&nbsp;even after shooting her role in&nbsp;the now-cult series, she still continued to&nbsp;walk dogs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a0f/a09/6a2f6c515d945d188577142b5b.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>Gwendoline later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “No&nbsp;one was more surprised than me&nbsp;that people liked my&nbsp;character in&nbsp;<i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i>.” She had doubts because her character wasn’t conventionally attractive. This is&nbsp;why she was shocked people liked her so&nbsp;much.</p><p>Her amazing acting got a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;awards. Christie was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nominated</a> for the 2019 Emmy for Best Supporting Actress. By&nbsp;the way, Gwendoline <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>submitted</a> her character for the candidate list herself, even though the show creators didn’t do&nbsp;it. She explained, “I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;the character and what&nbsp;I feel she represents.”</p><p>When she wasn’t busy in&nbsp;the series, Christie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appeared</a> in&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>. She portrayed Phasma, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first</a> female villain in&nbsp;the franchise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/044/722/85e45752f180d257d8305ce96b.jpg><p>Later, she was in&nbsp;<i>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay&nbsp;— Part&nbsp;2</i>, <i>Top of&nbsp;the Lake</i>. And of&nbsp;course, she got a&nbsp;brilliant role as&nbsp;Nevermore Academy headmistress Larissa Weems in&nbsp;Tim Burton’s series <i>Wednesday</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/89e/73f/15d7ea56298a2af3ce765ba0c6.jpg><p>In&nbsp;this role, Gwendoline felt beautiful on&nbsp;the screen for the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first</a> time ever thanks to&nbsp;director Tim Burton and costume designer Colleen Atwood, along with the rest of&nbsp;the crew who were responsible for makeup and hair.</p><p>The famous director gave Gwendoline full freedom for her character. The actress wanted to&nbsp;give her powerful and strong character more femininity. She was inspired by&nbsp;the main character from Hitchcock’s <i>The Birds</i>. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, Christie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noted</a> that she loved turning into characters that are not like her at&nbsp;all. And this role is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great example.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/876/587/91a68c5b829270cf99fe3497e1.jpg><p>Collin Xavier/Image Press Agency ABACA/Abaca/East News</p><p>Parallel to&nbsp;her main career, the actress is&nbsp;developing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>a&nbsp;modeling career</a> and is&nbsp;often invited to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;fashion shows. In&nbsp;2015, she became the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>face</a> of&nbsp;the Vivienne Westwood brand.</p><p>Gwendoline is&nbsp;also closely connected to&nbsp;the fashion world for a&nbsp;different reason. Since 2013, she has been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>relationship</a> with fashion designer Giles Deacon, who she’s been good friends with for a&nbsp;long time. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;best <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>known</a> for designing Pippa Middleton’s wedding dress. Christie supports Deacon in&nbsp;everything, regularly appearing in&nbsp;his dresses and calling him one of&nbsp;her favorite designers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8a8/004/5804dd51ec90afca16e005ef59.jpg><p>BOISIERE/SIPA/EAST NEWS</p><p>Gwendoline Christie once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “As&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, we&nbsp;all want to&nbsp;feel attractive. We&nbsp;all want to&nbsp;feel that we’re making the very best of&nbsp;ourselves, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;can accept ourselves.”</p><p>It&nbsp;seems that there are no&nbsp;viewers that don’t see her charm on&nbsp;the screen. Her success proves the fact that beauty standards change very often, and any of&nbsp;us can achieve whatever we&nbsp;want, no&nbsp;matter what other people think.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b5/c18/4a00a657da8a15541cd0940067.jpg><p>Richard Shotwell/Invision/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYysq6iqqWK8p3nGsJynnJ%2Bhtq%2BxjJyfq6Gjqbamedahpmavkah6tbvLnWSsoJWZeq%2Bx1Z6pZp%2BVqXqzu8ueqmZwYWaEc4KO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./narwhal-unicorn-puppy.html>&#171;&nbsp;Why Narwhal the 'Unicorn' Puppy Has a Tail on His Head</a>
