Her husband was always hungry and asked her to&nbsp;serve him a&nbsp;double portion for lunch every day. The woman thought something was wrong with her <a href=# title=cooking data-link=tag>cooking</a> skills, she had many theories on&nbsp;why this all was happening. But one day, life brought her the answer to&nbsp;this question and it&nbsp;was something that the poor woman will never forget or&nbsp;forgive.</p><p><h2>The woman sincerely wanted to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;her husband.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/84f/04e/de1bd1581a8e29d8d0550d16f3.jpg><p>Alyson, 30, wrote a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial and told&nbsp;us her story, which caused a&nbsp;huge stir in&nbsp;her life and broke her <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> apart.</p><p>The woman opened her letter, saying, «I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;live a&nbsp;happy life, but now I’m 99% sure&nbsp;I want a&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>. I&nbsp;could never have thought that my&nbsp;life would take such a&nbsp;whimsical and painful turn, but here we&nbsp;are, I’m heartbroken.»</p><p>Alyson went on&nbsp;with her story, saying, «My&nbsp;husband Frank and&nbsp;I have been married for almost 5&nbsp;years and we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;5-month-old <a href=# title=baby data-link=tag>baby</a>.</p><p>I&nbsp;work part-time and my&nbsp;earnings are only enough to&nbsp;supplement our income, and&nbsp;I also pay for the legal process of&nbsp;getting my&nbsp;husband documented. We&nbsp;were very fortunate to&nbsp;jump into an&nbsp;easy process that would take only 2&nbsp;years for Frank to&nbsp;obtain residency. But after what happened I’m going to&nbsp;cancel all this legal procedure and file for divorce.»</p><p>The woman described how she usually prepared her husband’s lunches. She wrote, «My&nbsp;routine used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;relatively busy. I&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;2&nbsp;hours before Frank every morning and&nbsp;I made him lunch and packed everything for him for work. I&nbsp;also prepared his breakfast, made his coffee and clothes ready for him. Then he&nbsp;would wake&nbsp;up, eat, get dressed, and leave for work in&nbsp;40&nbsp;minutes.»</p><p><h2>Alyson made sure her husband wasn’t hungry at&nbsp;work, but nothing seemed enough to&nbsp;him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bbd/01a/3a2e695de6b99e95a1ae7a5659.jpg><p>The woman goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, «Frank used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;satisfied with everything that&nbsp;I packed him for lunch. I&nbsp;opted for freshly cooked chicken in&nbsp;some sauce or&nbsp;some kind of&nbsp;chicken wrap. It&nbsp;always was some healthy food. I&nbsp;did this all for him because&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;make Frank’s life easier and this way&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;show him&nbsp;I cared and loved him. I’ve been serving his lunches since we&nbsp;first moved in&nbsp;together more than 5&nbsp;years ago.»</p><p>Alyson was shocked to&nbsp;find out that her husband was hungry all this time. The woman explained, «Recently I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;include dinner leftovers because Frank started asking for more food. He&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;was still hungry after he&nbsp;ate the lunches&nbsp;I served for him. I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was odd because no&nbsp;matter if&nbsp;I worked or&nbsp;not he&nbsp;always came home to&nbsp;the food being ready. So, even if&nbsp;he&nbsp;wasn’t full&nbsp;I was sure he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;okay. But I&nbsp;didn’t object to&nbsp;giving him bigger portions for lunch.»</p><p>The woman added, «So&nbsp;I&nbsp;started to&nbsp;double his portions, adding the food that&nbsp;I normally take to&nbsp;work. This meant&nbsp;I would go&nbsp;without lunch and&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;wait till after work or&nbsp;be&nbsp;late for work. I&nbsp;literally would have to&nbsp;wait until the food was ready and take some because&nbsp;I was breastfeeding and&nbsp;I couldn’t miss eating every time.»</p><p>The woman sacrificed her comfort for the sake of&nbsp;her husband’s, only to&nbsp;find that he&nbsp;was hiding something from her.</p><p>Alyson wrote," Last week when&nbsp;I was packing his lunch&nbsp;I saw a&nbsp;second fork in&nbsp;his lunchbox. I&nbsp;asked Frank about it&nbsp;and he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;had found it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the kitchen in&nbsp;his office and just brought it&nbsp;home. It&nbsp;sounded very weird to&nbsp;me, and&nbsp;I also noticed some changes in&nbsp;him. But I&nbsp;gaslighted myself into thinking that&nbsp;I was being insecure because&nbsp;I just had a&nbsp;baby. But this all made the pit of&nbsp;my&nbsp;stomach churn."</p><p><h2>One day, Alyson accidentally learned the truth behind her husband’s «hunger».</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b5/d97/1152d455ce9e59ad771c755895.jpg><p>Alyson goes on&nbsp;with her story, writing, «A&nbsp;few days later after&nbsp;I found that fork, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;his office during lunch to&nbsp;surprise him with dessert and for him to&nbsp;see our adorable baby. And that was the exact moment when&nbsp;I found out why he&nbsp;always wanted more food. Previously, we&nbsp;argued with one of&nbsp;his coworkers. I&nbsp;once caught him talking too friendly to&nbsp;her and&nbsp;I told him it&nbsp;made me&nbsp;very uncomfortable and stressed. He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;later that she left the company and wasn’t working there anymore. I&nbsp;had him remove this colleague from all his social networks and he&nbsp;blocked her on&nbsp;all messengers. So, this colleague was not only still working there but was eating the lunch&nbsp;I prepared for my&nbsp;husband and Frank was eating the leftovers.»</p><p>Alyson shared, «I&nbsp;didn’t cause a&nbsp;stir. I&nbsp;just took pictures of&nbsp;them eating that lunch together. I&nbsp;added these pictures to&nbsp;my&nbsp;folder of&nbsp;everything he’d done before. He&nbsp;was putting likes on&nbsp;other women’s stories, he&nbsp;had provocative pictures of&nbsp;a&nbsp;colleague from a&nbsp;previous job and he&nbsp;got fired from that job because of&nbsp;her.»</p><p>The woman was broken and hurt. She wrote, «I&nbsp;drove home crying and&nbsp;I packed my&nbsp;things. I&nbsp;took the bassinet all&nbsp;I needed for the baby and all my&nbsp;essentials. Then I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;my&nbsp;sister’s place and told everything to&nbsp;her and my&nbsp;BIL.»</p><p><h2>Alyson’s heart is&nbsp;broken, and so&nbsp;is&nbsp;her family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/465/1d4/5b283c5b5eaeda385affb4e12a.jpg><p>Alyson shared, «I&nbsp;normally text Frank during the day, and that day&nbsp;I just disappeared. Frank started texting me&nbsp;and calling me&nbsp;to&nbsp;check if&nbsp;I was okay and he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;ask what was for dinner. He&nbsp;was nervous. And then he&nbsp;came home an&nbsp;hour earlier than usual and saw that my&nbsp;and the baby’s things were gone.</p><p>Later that night&nbsp;I told him&nbsp;I wanted a&nbsp;divorce and&nbsp;I told him also that&nbsp;I was going to&nbsp;stop the legal procedure about his documenting that we&nbsp;started 2&nbsp;years ago. This all made him very mad. He&nbsp;was begging me&nbsp;not to&nbsp;leave him and to&nbsp;give him a&nbsp;chance. I&nbsp;just blocked him on&nbsp;everything, then he&nbsp;came to&nbsp;my&nbsp;sister’s house and she told him to&nbsp;leave or&nbsp;she was calling the police. I&nbsp;feel so&nbsp;broken, lost, and depressed. But I&nbsp;know that I’m doing everything right because it’s better to&nbsp;be&nbsp;alone and a&nbsp;single mom rather than living all my&nbsp;life with a&nbsp;liar who makes me&nbsp;cook food for his mistresses.»</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, who didn’t need to&nbsp;hire a&nbsp;<a href=#>private detective</a> to&nbsp;find out if&nbsp;her boyfriend was cheating on&nbsp;her.
