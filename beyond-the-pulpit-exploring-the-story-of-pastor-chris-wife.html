themself. <a href=# id=52cf3e4b-7bfb-420a-bfb6-67a88d39f7ab data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>Pastor Chris Oyakhilome</a>, a globally renowned televangelist and the founder of Christ Embassy, was accompanied on his spiritual journey by his <a href=# id=9ca75403-1b8f-438a-8aa3-0a9be4a8f944 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>wife</a>, <strong>Pastor Anita Oyakhilome</strong>.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>Early life and spiritual foundation of Pastor Chris’ wife</h3></p><p>Pastor Anita Oyakhilome, born Anita Ebhodaghe, hails from a Nigerian family. Her journey into spirituality began at an early age, influenced by her family's Christian values and teachings. As she navigated through life, Anita Oyakhilome developed a profound connection with her faith, laying the groundwork for her future endeavours in ministry.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>Marriage to Pastor Chris Oyakhilome</h3></p><p>The marriage between Pastor Chris and Anita Oyakhilome lasted from 1991 to 2016. Their union was bound by shared beliefs and a commitment to spreading the message of Christianity, which has been a beacon of inspiration for many around the world.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Together, they worked tirelessly to build Christ Embassy into a global ministry, reaching millions through various mediums, including television broadcasts, conferences, and literature.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>The greatest blessings of Pastor Chris and his wife</h3></p><p>Even though Pastor Chris and his wife separated in 2014 and eventually divorced in 2016, they shared a unified pride of their ministry, Christ Embassy, and most importantly, their greatest achievement: their daughters.</p><p>The pride that parents feel towards their children is a profound and indescribable emotion that transcends words. It is a sentiment born out of witnessing the growth, achievements, and unique qualities of their offspring. From the first steps taken as toddlers to the significant milestones reached in adulthood, parents experience an overwhelming sense of joy and accomplishment.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The pride is not solely tied to academic or professional successes but extends to the development of character, kindness, and resilience in their children. Seeing their daughters navigate challenges, overcome obstacles, and embrace their individuality filled Pastor Chris and his wife with a deep sense of fulfillment.</p><p>This pride is a testament to the enduring connection and unwavering love that most parents feel as they watch their children embark on their life journey, carrying the hopes and dreams of their <a href=# id=6632becd-f4a6-4d08-82db-77a2dd24f028 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>family</a> forward. This is the bond that Pastor Chris and his wife will continue to share forever.</p><p><strong>Carissa Sharon Oyakhilome</strong>, also known by her stage name CSO, was born in 1993, followed by the birth of her sister, Charlene, two years later in 1995. Both girls were brought up with the influence of the ministry and were instilled with strong Christian values synonymous with the Church.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-18>Family matters</h3></p><p>Carissa Sharon Oyakhilome has always been actively involved in Christ Embassy. She is a successful gospel singer and songwriter within the LoveWorld Music and Arts Ministry (LMAM) and has enjoyed international fame and popularity with her gospel career.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In October 2018, she married the love of her life, successful Ghanaian businessman Phillip Frimpong in a lavish ceremony officiated by the close family friend televangelist Pastor Benny Hinn in Lagos, Nigeria.</p><p>Two and a half years later, Carissa Sharon Oyakhilome gave her parents their first grandchild, daughter <strong>Arielle Rachelle-Marise</strong>. Charlene Oyakhilome is very private and prefers to stay away from the limelight. She lives a spiritual Christian life and resides in the United Kingdom close to her mother.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-22>Contributions of Pastor Chris’ wife to the early rise of Christ Embassy</h3></p><p>Pastor Chris’ wife, Anita Oyakhilome, played a pivotal role in the growth and success of Christ Embassy. Her involvement in various aspects of the ministry, including teaching, counseling, and humanitarian efforts, left an indelible mark on the organization. She empowered women to embrace their spirituality and contribute meaningfully to their communities.</p><p>Beyond her administrative responsibilities, Pastor Anita Oyakhilome was known for her dynamic and insightful teachings. Her sermons often focused on practical applications of biblical principles in everyday life, addressing issues that resonated with a diverse audience.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Through her words, she inspired countless people to deepen their relationship with God and live purposeful lives. Pastor Chris’ now ex-wife still leads a deeply spiritual Christian life and is actively involved in various humanitarian initiatives, making a positive impact on communities around the world.</p><p>From healthcare projects to educational programs, her efforts reflect a genuine desire to alleviate suffering and promote a message of love and compassion. She currently resides in the United Kingdom and continues her religious and philanthropic work in her community there.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-27>Challenges and personal growth</h3></p><p>Throughout the painful separation and ultimate divorce of Pastor Chis and his wife, Anita Oyakhilome, they faced scrutiny and gossip, which they navigated with grace and sensitivity. The challenges they faced both privately and in the public eye were extremely difficult for both parties.</p><p>Despite the difficulties, they both demonstrated resilience and grace. It is believed that Pastor Chris’ wife used these experiences to connect with others facing similar struggles, and her authenticity in addressing life's challenges has endeared her to many, making her a relatable figure in the world of ministry.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Pastor Anita Oyakhilome's journey is one of faith, grace, and unwavering dedication to the principles of Christianity. As a vital part of the early days of Christ Embassy ministry, she contributed to the writing of "<a href=# id=7e70e10f-8cb4-44cf-ad7b-f35dd61ec8d4 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>Rhapsody of Realities</a>," the most widely distributed daily devotional in the world, and she emerged as an inspiration to multiple people. They now lead separate lives with common values.</p><p>Pastor Chris Oyakhilome continues his path to ensure that the Word of God is taken to the ends of the earth in all living languages.
