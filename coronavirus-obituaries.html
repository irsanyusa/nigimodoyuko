But just being alone is only part of the difficulty. Our sense of remoteness is intensified by a pall of unease we can’t define: Loss and sorrow are also in the air. We fear losing—or we may have already lost—people we love. And when we work up the courage to look beyond our individual personal spheres, we see that many people who have made our world better, in big and small ways, have vanished before we were ready to let them go.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But not even sorrow is one-dimensional. There can always be at least a glimmer of joy in remembering things that people gave us while they were here. In his jubilant and revivifying memoir, I Remember, the artist and writer Joe Brainard tabulated all the little things that can come to shape how we think about life. It’s a book of large truths disguised as small ones: “I remember,” he writes, “those times of not knowing if you feel really happy or really sad. (Wet eyes and a high heart.)”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We have no roadmap for this new territory. But we all, at one time or another, have reason to mourn. Maybe we can be better at celebrating life even as we’re saddened by its loss. That’s the goal of this list: to acknowledge the remarkable and joyful lives of some of those we have lost. It’s not comprehensive, nor is it meant to be. These are just some of the people who have been taken from us, even as they have left us much to remember them by. Let’s think of them with wet eyes and a high heart. —Stephanie Zacharek</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Romi Aneja</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Romi-Aneja.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This Mother’s Day, my mom was sedated and on a ventilator. On a day when we would usually shower her with gifts and take her out to lunch, my family huddled around our phones and tablets as the nurse showed her to us over video chat.

She was 64. My mom had also been fighting rheumatoid arthritis for many years. This meant she was immunocompromised and part of a population that is especially vulnerable to this disease.

As a helicopter whirred above, a line of black-and-whites <a href=# rel=noopener>stretching to the horizon</a> traveled more than 50 miles, escorting a hearse that drove her body from a hospital in Vallejo to a cemetery in Napa.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Marylou made a difference, as a detective and as a person,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Santa Rosa Police Chief Rainer Navarro</a> told the Sonoma <i>Index-Tribune</i>. “She exude[d] the professionalism and the character that I think every person in our department carries.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Law enforcement officers throughout the country have been struck by the virus, as they have continued to go to work amid the pandemic. Acknowledging these circumstances, local officials described Armer’s death as occurring in the line of duty. The detective tested positive for COVID-19 in early March and died on March 31, leaving behind her husband and daughter. She was 43.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Marylou was a bright light in this organization,” Navarro said in a video <a href=# rel=noopener>statement</a>. “Marylou was always proactive and there with a smile.

Later, she became one of the first researchers to receive a Chinese government scholarship to spend two years as a foreign student in Beijing. She also worked part-time at the Chicago <i>Tribune’s</i> Beijing bureau, compiling clips of Western media reports on China.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1980, she returned to the Philippines and <a href=# rel=noopener>worked as</a> a government researcher at the Department of Foreign Affairs. From there, she ventured back into academia, teaching at Ateneo de Manila University and the University of the Philippines, where she earned a Ph.D. in political science in 2003. She then served as dean of the university’s Asian Center from 2003 to 2009. Her colleagues and students remember her for her balanced insight on Philippines-China relations and influential ideas about the social and economic issues common to the two developing countries.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“She shared her network with us her students and was responsible for making the study of international relations in the Philippines accessible to as many people as possible,” Ederson Delos Trino Tapia, one of Baviera’s former students, says.

He was only 42 years old and worked for Lenox Hill Hospital as a mason in the healthcare union and was an essential worker. He was admitted to Mount Sinai hospital after visiting an urgent care – he was told he had a double lung infection. One week later, my heart was forever broken as my beautiful brother passed away from COVID-19.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gianmarco loved deeply, smiled often and had no enemies. He loved the city of New Orleans, his father’s cooking and his self-renovated apartment in Astoria, Queens. He was unique and pure and a really good listener. He was adventurous, from trying new (often pretty disgusting) delicacies to exploring new cities and locales. Some of my happiest memories involve him singing and dancing, full of life and love. He was good with his hands and created breathtaking art. I remember how Gianmarco would run to my grandmother, holding her hand and offering support for her to walk—he at 6′ 2,” her less than 5′.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He had friends that he just met and ones he’d known over 35 years. Since his passing, I’ve discovered that so many people loved my brother just as much as I did. He didn’t judge, was laid back and music truly moved his soul. He loved a good debate, was loyal and loved his family with all his heart.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gianmarco loved to read and learning excited him. He was diverse in his interests and just a really good dude. Since we’d lost our mother 6 years ago and our grandmother 2 years ago, my father, Gianmarco and I had been a team, one that is now forever broken. I’ve learned that Gianmarco had a special way about him that forged a lasting bond with everyone he met.

He majored in art history at Columbia and immersed himself in the local art and music scenes during a countercultural explosion, going to galleries every Saturday morning and seeing young talents like Jimi Hendrix and David Bowie at local venues at night.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As a classmate, he was incredibly intellectually curious and well-read. “He had a photographic memory about things,” says Tej Hazarika, a college friend. “He was so scholarly and always wanted to go deeper into topics.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Black dropped out in 1970. For the rest of his life, he would live a minimal, solitary lifestyle and take on odd jobs to pay the bills. When he wasn’t working for money, he was pouring himself into his artwork. His specialty medium was lead pencils, which he would sharpen by hand with an X-acto knife.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His work was often minuscule and teemed with real and fictional characters and artistic artifacts: Duchamp’s urinal hanging next to the head of Coco Chanel; surrealist André Breton next to actor Buster Keaton. The artworks were so dense and detailed that at his 2013 show, each piece of art was accompanied by a magnifying glass and a guide with labels and annotations. “Each composition is like a symphony or a novel,” Hazarika says. “They were powerful slices of myth and reality.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If Black was pleasantly surprised by his late-career success, he wasn’t expecting or even hoping for it. “He wasn’t interested in the money, the fame or fortune,” Murphy said. “I don’t think he ever thought about selling his art. He just did it.” <i>—</i><i>Andrew R.

A place like Tabla asked diners to forget what they thought they knew about Indian cuisine — standard curries, doughy naans — and surrender to new interpretations. A spirit of celebration and warmth was pervasive; Cardoz was both fearless about expectations and passionate about his heritage, combining traditional Indian cooking with American, Italian and French twists and techniques.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The restaurant is now part of his legacy.

After Tabla, he worked at two more restaurants in New York before launching the cozy, hip downtown spot Paowalla (later reimagined and renamed Bombay Bread Bar) and two destinations in Mumbai. At Paowalla, colorful murals decorated the interior’s brick walls, and dishes like bacon-stuffed naan, masala-spiced popcorn or burrata in daal were meant to be shared, epitomizing his style of open-armed hospitality.

And while this stereotype might be true in rare cases, for the most part, the traveling pack of sports journalists who type the words and shoot the pictures at arenas and stadiums across the country are passionate professionals who work odd, long nighttime and weekend hours far away from their families. The best of them would never complain about their fates—it’s still a hell of a way to make a living—but the job involves its fair share of inglorious gruntwork.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And in those moments after the games, before they have to head back to another faceless hotel room to rest up for the next event, sports journalists often only have each other to lean on. The pack forms a family. They’re good, funny people. They’re guys<b>—</b>and, more commonly these days, women<b>—</b>with whom you’d love to share a late-night beer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So the April 12 death of New York<i> Post </i>sports photographer Anthony Causi, at age 48 after battling Covid-19, was a particular gut punch to that Big Apple family, which is competitive in the photo pits and press boxes, but particularly tight off the field. Causi was a favorite son. He was the person who, before or after a game, would drop his 50 pounds of photography equipment and insist on snapping a group shot of his colleagues and their families, if they happened to be at the field. “He was always looking to make people happy,” says <i>Post</i> sports columnist Mike Vaccaro, who had the unenviable task of <a href=# rel=noopener>eulogizing his friend</a> in print after his death (Causi carried the<a href=# rel=noopener><i> Post’s</i> back page</a>). “I know it sounds too good to be true. But it really was.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Causi, who leaves behind his wife and two children, won the respect of his colleagues and the athletes he covered because he combined kindness with sheer talent. His work speaks for itself: The shot of Derek Jeter <a href=# rel=noopener>touching</a> the “I want to thank the Good Lord for making me a Yankee” sign, Serena Williams at a US Open <a href=# rel=noopener>evening appointment, </a>Megan Rapinoe <a href=# rel=noopener>flashing hardware</a> at a ticker-tape parade, Jeter’s <a href=# rel=noopener>comically unenthusiastic</a> response to Alex Rodriguez joining the Yanks in 2004. Tributes to Causi came pouring in, from <a href=# rel=noopener>Jeter</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>A-Rod</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Conor McGregor,</a> and the New York <a href=# rel=noopener>pro</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>sports</a> teams.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Great sports photographers are like great point guards,” says Vaccaro. “They have to anticipate what’s going to happen two or three plays ahead.” Vaccaro points to his favorite Causi picture: of Eli Manning <a href=# rel=noopener>hugging his daughters </a>at MetLife Stadium in December, after he played his final game as a New York Giant. “You can see all the other photographers in the background,” says Vaccaro, “not getting the picture Anthony managed to get.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Among his colleagues, one moment stands out: at spring training in 2016, New York Mets outfielder Yoenis Cespedes took to arriving at the Florida facility in a variety of tricked-out cars. A<a href=# rel=noopener> Polaris Slinghot </a>one morning, a<a href=# rel=noopener> Black Lamborghini</a> the next. The photogs took to staking out the Mets parking lot each day, waiting to snap a shot of the next vehicle. “Only Anthony had the freaking balls to ask Cespedes for a ride,” says Christian Perez, a cameraman for the SNY cable network. Cespedes said yes. So he and Causi went streaking out of the parking lot at about 60 miles per hour. Causi got the shot. He always did. —<i>Sean Gregory</i></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Rabbi Romi Cohn</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/romi-cohn-obit-covid.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He was condemned to die at age 13, but his life was spared.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rabbi “Romi” Cohn explained this as he performed an opening prayer for the U.S. House of Representatives in January. It was the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and Cohn, a man credited with saving the lives of 56 Jewish families, was there, in part, to remind everyone of the Holocaust that many others didn’t survive — including his own mother and four siblings.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The man known more formally as Avraham Hakohen Cohn died on March 24 after being hospitalized with the coronavirus in his adopted New York City home. He was 91.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Born in 1929 in what is now Slovakia, Cohn was just a teenager when his family slipped him across the border into Hungary as those around him were being forced into concentration camps. Returning home after Hungary started mass deportation, he successfully worked to help Jewish refugees evade the Nazis, supplying them with housing and false papers, according to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Jewish Partisan Educational Foundation</a>. After the war, he moved to the United States and became a successful real estate developer on Staten Island. Cohn was also a passionate mohel, a figure who performs ritual circumcisions; he performed some 35,000 and did so for free. He also trained more than 100 other mohels, on the condition that they also refuse payment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Rabbi Cohn lived an incredible life of service,” his congressman, Rep. Max Rose, tweeted upon the news of his death. “His legacy reminds [us] to never accept bigotry,” Rose previously tweeted less than two months earlier, to commemorate his constituent’s prayer at the U.S. Capitol.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That day in January, Cohn was also there to impart a blessing on America’s leaders and lawmakers, people who would soon be struggling to save American lives amid the pandemic that took his own. “May the Lord deal kindly and graciously with you,” the rabbi told them. “May the Lord bestow his favor upon you and grant you peace.” —Katy Steinmetz</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>John Horton Conway</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/John-Horton-Conway-obit.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For most people, there may be no greater oxymoron than “recreational mathematics.” But most people aren’t John Horton Conway, the John von Neumann Professor in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Princeton University, who died from complications relating to COVID-19 on April 11 at age 82.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Conway was best known for inventing the “cellular automaton” Game of Life, which is a two-dimensional grid in which each square interacts with adjacent squares according to certain rules until complexity results. Sounds dry—as long as you overlook the fact that its system-building dynamics explain, well, everything in the world, including life itself.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The mere names of Conway’s books and fields of study capture the playfulness in his genius. He was the co-author of <i>On Quaternions and Octonions</i> and <i>The Sensual (Quadratic) Form</i>. He studied knot theory, tangle theory, surreal numbers and lattices in higher dimensions. As Peter Doyle, professor of mathematics at Dartmouth University and a friend of Conway’s, said <a href=# rel=noopener>in a Princeton news release</a>, “People invariably describe Conway as the inventor of The Game of Life. That’s like describing Bob Dylan as the author of ‘Blowin’ in the Wind’.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Conway might actually be more notably remembered for co-developing the Free Will Theorem of quantum mechanics in 2004, positing nothing short of the idea that if humans have the freedom to choose which experiments they will run with elementary particles, then the elementary particles have similar free will, able to choose their rate and direction of spin. Doubt that? OK, prove he was wrong.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Then, too, there was Conway’s love of magic tricks, colorful models to illustrate mathematical concepts and the cards, dice and even Slinkys he would sometimes carry with him both for play and for proving principles. “Recreational mathematics” fairly lived within Conway—and it died a small death with his too-soon passing. <i>—Jeffrey Kluger</i></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Nick Cordero</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nick-cordero-covid-obit.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Before COVID-19, actor <a href=#>Nick Cordero</a> was in the prime of his life.

Cordero, who according to his wife had no preexisting health conditions, contracted the disease in March.

Costa was also a pianist, and had recently learned to play the mandolin.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But more than anything, Costa loved being a doctor. Even Hart admitted his husband was a bit of a workaholic, always putting his patients and colleagues first until the very end.

As both a reporter and editor, he covered New York City government, international news, sports, higher education, labor, transportation and much more.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But no matter the subject, Finder approached his stories with the same even-keeled work ethic and attention to detail. He challenged power structures and gave voice to the disenfranchised; he was beloved by colleagues and served as an essential mentor to several generations of budding journalists. He died at 72 on March 24 after battling coronavirus for several weeks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Twitter, <i>Times</i> editor and reporter Richard Perez-Pena<a href=# rel=noopener> called him</a> “the greatest colleague I’ve ever had and one of the best people I’ve known” and also noted that “Alan was a font of sanity, decency, wisdom, humor and calm in a crazy, often harsh business.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Finder was born in 1948 in Brooklyn and started his career as a local cub reporter for the Bergen Record in Hackensack, N.J. After a four-year stint at Newsday he joined the <i>Times</i> in 1983, where he distinguished himself for his diligent approach to covering highly technical and corruption-plagued realms like housing, labor and transportation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Joan Nassivera arrived at the newspaper in 1988 as an editor, the first story she edited was one of Finder’s. “He understood who pulled the wheels of power and how these people intersected—and could explain it all to the average reader and make it interesting,” she said. “He treated editors as equals or better, even though he didn’t really need any help.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1994, his reporting<a href=# rel=noopener> deflated New York City’s claim</a> that it was giving more city contracts to women- and minority-owned companies.

The Freedom Riders, who traveled the American South to challenge the segregation of buses and terminals, revealed American injustice to the world, charted a course of nonviolent action that would lead to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and galvanized a new generation of civil rights leaders. Along the way, they were met by vicious mobs and eventually federal intervention. And Gaffney was there to capture it all. On Easter Sunday, the longtime photographer died at age 92 from the coronavirus.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He was interested in documenting the struggle of people of African descent here in the U.S.,” his wife, Maria Santos-Gaffney, tells TIME. “He would say, ‘If you don’t believe you can change things, you won’t know until you try.’”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Theodore Gaffney was born Nov. 22, 1927 in Washington, D.C. He was the descendant of slaves who worked on a plantation near Gaffney, S.C., his cousin Patricia Johnson<a href=# rel=noopener> told the Washington <i>Post</i></a><i>.</i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Gaffney came of age, he enlisted in the Army and entered active duty just after World War II. After his service ended, he took classes at Catholic and Howard Universities and developed an interest in photography.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As a photographer, he spent much of his time photographing politicians and activists on Capitol Hill. In 1956, he found himself the subject of news when pro-segregation Sen. Olin Johnston ordered a Senate guard to seize his film after Gaffney took a picture of Johnston and NAACP representative Clarence Mitchell.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Five years later, when Gaffney was 33, <i>Jet</i> asked him to join the Freedom Riders. The rides would soon turn violent as mobs targeted the buses. Gaffney says his position made him especially vulnerable, since their attackers did not want their violence documented. At one point, white supremacists boarded the bus and began beating activists. Gaffney snapped two pictures and then slipped his camera back into his pocket.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I was wondering if I was crazy,” he said in the 2011 interview. “I don’t know how they train you to be nonviolent when you’re getting your head beaten. I was afraid I might not come back.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gaffney made it out safely and resumed work on Capitol Hill.

He was recently resentenced, following a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that banned life-without-parole sentences for minors, and was offered parole in February. However, he turned it down because he felt the court had done him an injustice with his original sentence, according to MDOC spokesperson Chris Gautz.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Garrison had accrued “more than 7,000 days of good time credit” while incarcerated, “and thought he should be allowed to be freed without parole,” Gautz tells TIME. “This was just an unfortunate case all the way around.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Garrison was later identified among prisoners “vulnerable” to COVID-19 as it began spreading in jails and prisons across the U.S., and was included in an MDOC list of parole-eligible inmates who could have been released early. Although he had consented to be paroled on those grounds, Garrison died while waiting to hear if the county prosecutor’s office would appeal his release.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other Macomb inmates have since said Garrison’s cellmate had been sick prior to his death, Yolanda Peterson claims.

It was miraculous that she met her future husband literally in the playpen, when she was three and he was just 19 months old. (Their parents were part of a local cards club.) It was miraculous that they married 20 years later, in 1943, and remained together for 73 years until Senator Glenn’s death in 2016.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I have never known a world that didn’t include Annie,” he told me when I spoke with him before his second flight to space, at age 77, in 1998.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And it was miraculous too that Annie Glenn survived and thrived in a national spotlight for decade upon decade while suffering from a stutter so paralyzing that when she was a young woman, she would write down her destination and hand the paper to a bus driver rather than attempt to speak her stop. Glenn eventually overcame the problem after undergoing intensive therapy in the 1970s, and went on to campaign for her husband during his presidential run in 1984. She was honored with the Department of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service in 1998, but more important was the annual award named <i>for</i> her by the National Association for Hearing and Speech Action, in 1987.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It is a story often told—and a true one—that before John Glenn went off to war in 1944, he told his then-new wife that he was just going down to the corner store for a pack of gum.

He had been in the hospital for several weeks; on April 6, he posted a picture of himself wearing an oxygen mask on Twitter, <a href=# rel=noopener>writing</a>, “Please keep me in y’all prayers!!!” He was 41, according to his manager David Evans.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Born Frederick Thomas in the South Bronx, Fred the Godson grew up in poverty, with a father who struggled with crack cocaine use. When he was a child, a fire in his apartment forced his family—which included his parents and five siblings—into a two-room shelter.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As a high schooler, Fred the Godson was a firsthand witness to New York’s golden age of hip-hop in the ‘90s, in which the Notorious B.I.G., Nas and Jay-Z all rose to prominence out of low-income neighborhoods. Fred the Godson idolized that slick-talking, verbose trio and rapped casually himself, but was hesitant to pursue it as a career: “I looked at rappers like superheroes,” he <a href=# rel=noopener>said in a 2012 interview</a>. “I have rappers on this pedestal that was so high, I never thought that I could reach it myself.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But as he progressed as a wordsmith, lacing his rhymes with metaphors and witty homonyms, he quickly realized his skill far outpaced that of many in the field. His first two mixtapes, <i>Armageddon</i> and <i>City of God</i>, became cult favorites in an era when mixtapes were still a dominant part of the hip-hop landscape. In 2011, he landed on the<a href=# rel=noopener> cover of XXL Magazine</a> as part of their annual Freshman Class, alongside Kendrick Lamar, Meek Mill and Mac Miller.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Over the next decade, Fred the Godson would deliver hundreds of voluminous, pugilistic verses on his own mixtapes and other artists’ projects. He collaborated with Diddy, Pusha T, Busta Rhymes, Fat Joe, Meek Mill and many other high-profile artists. He continuously resisted signing with a label: “There’s a lot of rappers I know that are signed and don’t make as much as me,” he said in a 2017 <a href=# rel=noopener>interview</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While he didn’t receive the chart success of his aforementioned colleagues, he became a respected underground veteran. His verses were stuffed with double entendres and wordplay that made listeners rewind their tapes. <a href=# rel=noopener>These included</a>: “No label, the block signed him/ Flow off the noodle, I’m top rhymin’ [top ramen]’”; “These A&Rs are comedians like Jerry/ Cause everything they sign fell [Seinfeld]”; “Professionals built the titanic, but amateurs built the arc/ Yeah I nailed it, the hammer is in the park/ My flow they cut and paste, my grammar is very sharp.” =</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He was especially active over the past six months, releasing three tapes: <i>God Level</i> in November, <i>Training Day</i> with <i>SNL </i>alum Jay Pharaoh in January, and <i>Payback</i> in March. But in early April, he was taken to the hospital, where he died several weeks later. His numerous health isses, including kidney failure, high blood pressure and diabetes, put him at higher risk after contracting the coronavirus.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The radio personality Sway Calloway <a href=# rel=noopener>said that Fred the Godson</a> “personifies what a true MC is.” The<a href=# rel=noopener> DJ Clark Kent</a> called him “easily one of the most dangerous MC’s around.” And the rapper Kemba, who is also from the Bronx, said he looked up to Fred the Godson as an aspiring lyricist. “Everyone thought he was the best,” he<a href=# rel=noopener> wrote on Twitter</a>. “I was trying to be as good as he was.” <i>—Andrew R.

Also rare are doctors who have the ability to navigate the daunting complexities of their condition. James Goodrich, a pioneering neurosurgeon, was world-renowned for developing a method that could separate twins who were joined at the brain and skull. He shared his expertise in hundreds of cases and led teams through marathon surgeries that famously yielded independent lives.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Goodrich died on March 30 due to complications from the coronavirus, according to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, where he worked for more than 30 years. He was 73. In a <a href=# rel=noopener>statement</a>, colleagues at the institution remembered the director of pediatric neurosurgery for his singular skills, but also for his humility. Every year, they noted, he baked holiday cookies and brought them to the nurses at the children’s hospital.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“His expertise and ability were second only to his kind heart and manner,” said Dr. Philip O.

The surgery lasted 27 hours. In an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview</a> with CNN afterwards, one of his fellow doctors said that it was incredible to see, one millimeter at a time, “one turn into two.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another case involved Carl and Clarence Aguirre, twins from the Philippines who were joined at the top of their heads.

The fading boxing photos and memorabilia on the wall, the jukebox stocked with primo R&B, the bar itself, packed with patrons elbow-to-elbow at the end of the workday: These are all great things, but best of all was to see Glenn wandering through, his carriage sturdy but elegant, surveying his kingdom of happy customers and $3 drinks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Glenn, himself a former amateur boxer, always had the ring in his heart: He’d been a trainer or cut man for a long list of fighters, including Floyd Patterson and Michael Spinks. He was friends with Muhammad Ali, who would sometimes stop by the Times Square gym Glenn ran in the 1980s and early 1990s. Glenn’s son has vowed that the bar, temporarily closed due to the pandemic, will remain in business.

A few days earlier, Stephen had tested positive for the coronavirus. He asked one of the nurses for water that morning; though he’d had an up and down fever, Stephen, who’s my father’s brother—my uncle—hadn’t been displaying any great respiratory distress. We thought he’d pull through.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But COVID-19, <a href=#>my family learned firsthand</a>, ravages quickly. At some point that afternoon, his breathing stopped. Stephen Gregory—whose lanky moves propelled him to Best Dancer honors at the Park Gardens Rehabilitation and Nursing Center annual Academy Awards ceremony—was pronounced dead, after complications from the coronavirus. He was 68.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">COVID-19 has stolen an all-too broad swath of humanity. This pandemic, however, has taken a particularly cruel toll on homes housing the sick, the old and infirm, the developmentally disabled. Those able to fight the coronavirus least. COVID-19 has stolen people like my uncle Stephen, who spent his life suffering from mental illness. He existed in the shadows of society, largely forgotten by all except his immediate family and those who cared for him, daily.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stephen spent the majority of his adult life under state care. He couldn’t leave the nursing home unless someone signed him out.

The sociology professor at the City University of New York spent years of his life walking around his city, engaging with residents face-to-face and unearthing their local histories. His quest to cover every single block of the city was documented in a series of acclaimed books, most notably <a href=# rel=noopener><i>The New York Nobody Knows: Walking 6,000 Miles in the City.</i></a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“People told me that people are not going to talk to me in New York: that they’re busy, they’re running around, and they’re nasty,” Helmreich said in a<a href=# rel=noopener> 2015 interview</a>. “All of that turned out to be false.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On March 28, Helmreich died at 74 from the coronavirus in his home in Great Neck, N.Y.

His parents, Holocaust survivors, brought him to America a year later. They settled on the Upper West Side, but didn’t stay within the confines of the neighborhood: On weekends, Helmreich’s father would play a game with him called Last Stop, in which they would take a subway line to its final destination, then get out and discover the neighborhood.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“When we ran out of last stops, we went to the second to last stop, then the third to last stop,” he said in the same interview.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Through these explorations, Helmreich developed a deep fascination with under-documented parts of the city. After attending Yeshiva University and obtaining a doctorate at Washington University, he became a sociology professor at City College—a position he would hold for over 40 years, exploring urban sociology, religion, gentrification and the lives of Holocaust survivors.

It could have been partly due to his time in the U.S. Army Specialized Training Program during WWII, but more likely it was a testament to his meticulous personality. “He never had a speeding ticket, never paid a bill late,” his son Dean recalls.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dean describes his father as extremely organized, keeping old photos and documents in pristine condition for decades. So for Henry to be given a less-than-honorable discharge in 1945, after more than two years of service, seemed confusing at best—and racist at worst.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Henry, or “Pop Pop” as he was often called, long worked to get his status upgraded, and finally saw his <a href=# rel=noopener>dream realized</a> in 2019, about a year before he died of complications related to the coronavirus on May 9. He was 96.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Had he gotten this discharge upgrade back in the 40s, when he was trying, who knows what the trajectory would have been for him,” says Dean. Despite the injustice, Henry eventually earned a psychology degree from Temple University and went on to work in the Pennsylvania state employment office, after driving a taxi for many years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Elizabeth Kristen, Director of Gender Equity and LGBTQ Rights at Legal Aid at Work, began working with Henry to get his case upgraded in 2018. Although technically neither honorable or dishonorable, a blue discharge is stigmatized to be a stain on a veteran’s record. It was also disproportionately distributed to Black and LGBT service members during WWII, with Black people receiving 22.2% of blue discharges, although they were only 6.5% of the Army, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Legal Aid at Work</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kristen says discharge upgrade cases are notoriously difficult to win, but despite the weak odds they went ahead with the formal process. With the help of a local reporter, Henry’s case caught the attention of his state’s Senators, which helped get it on the Army’s radar. The Army then delivered the news Henry patiently waited nearly 75 years to hear: honorably discharged.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Upon hearing the news, Kristen says “You could just see the light come back into his face.” —<i>Nadia Suleman</i></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Skylar Herbert</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Skylar-Herbert-obit.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Those who knew 5-year-old Skylar Herbert the very best have described her as beautifully affectionate, always ready to give the things that are most precious. “She was the type of girl that would just run up to you and jump in your arms and hug you,” her mother, police officer LaVondria Herbert, told the <a href=# rel=noopener>Detroit News</a>. “It didn’t matter what she was doing, she would stop what she was doing and tell me she loved me like 20 times a day.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After weeks of struggling against complications of COVID-19, Skylar Herbert died on April 19.

But when the 82-year-old died in London, on April 1, of complications relating to the coronavirus, Somalia’s current president declared three days of national mourning. In a moving <a href=# rel=noopener>statement</a>, President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo said it was in recognition of all that Hussein had done for Somalia and its people, and that it would give the prime minister “the respect he deserves.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hussein took office in November of 2007, when Somalia was still reeling from a devastating civil war between Islamist insurgents, western-backed Somali forces and proxies of neigboring rivals Ethiopia and Eritrea. Tens of thousands had fled into exile; nearly a million were displaced from fighting in the Somali capital, <a href=#>Mogadishu</a>, creating a <a href=# rel=noopener>humanitarian disaster</a>. As prime minister, Hussein directed negotiations between the warring parties, which resulted in a groundbreaking peace agreement and the formation of a unity government in 2008. Somalis call him by the nickname ‘Nur Adde,’ both an honorific and a play on his first name, which means light.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In early 2009, influential Somali newspaper Hiiraan Online named him the 2008 Person of the Year, for “giving the war-weary people of Somalia hope,” and “contributing to national reconciliation in Somalia in the face of stiff internal and external resistance.” His 2007 predecessor for that award, Somali-American humanitarian <a href=# rel=noopener>Abdi Muuse Maaxaay</a>, tells TIME that Somalis will never be able to forget what Hussein did for them. “His vision was to bring Somalia a lasting peace through dialogue.

Bill, a preacher, opened several churches in the Midwest after their wedding in 1954. Later, when the pair led a mission trip to Jamaica in the late ‘50s, they became so enchanted by the Caribbean island that they decided to stay, and ran a church in Montego Bay for a decade. They also adopted Milewski from a Miami foster home during that period.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1969, the family moved from Jamaica to Lebanon, where Bill taught and ministered to college students and Esther performed in a Christian rock band and started an outreach center. They were forced to leave in 1976, a year after civil war broke out in the country.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">They eventually settled in West Palm Beach, where they remained for the last forty years.

Over a three-decade career, the dialogue coach worked on more than 80 movies, including some of the biggest franchises in film history, from <i>Star Wars </i>to <i>Lord of the Rings </i>to <i>Avengers</i>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jack helped Robert Downey Jr., a New Yorker, master Sherlock Holmes’ brusque London accent. He transformed Chris Hemsworth’s Australian drawl into Thor’s Asgardian intonations. He was instrumental in creating the many strange languages and dialects of J.R.R. Tolkein’s Middle Earth, from elvish to Black Speech to the Hobbit’s Gloucestershire-based lilt. And with his flowing white hair and towering figure, he also secured a role as Major Caluan Ematt in <i>Star Wars</i> episodes VII and VIII.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On March 31, Jack died at 76 from complications from the coronavirus. “He was in no pain, and he slipped away peacefully knowing that his family were all ‘with’ him,” his wife,<a href=# rel=noopener> Gabrielle Rogers, tweeted</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Born in 1944, Jack began his career as an actor, with his voice serving as his main talent: He did radio broadcasting for the BBC and overdubbed lines in films.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the ‘70s, his acting gigs ran dry and he became a flight attendant. “I flew around the world and suddenly discovered I was learning all these accents,” he said in a<a href=# rel=noopener> 2009 interview</a>. He got a job teaching voice and dialect at The London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art for many years before securing his first major dialect coaching gig, on 1989’s <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Over the last two decades, Jack was in high demand, working on some of the biggest projects in Hollywood. In addition to helping Pierce Brosnan become James Bond and Christian Bale become Batman, he taught Greek and Trojan accents on 2004’s <i>Troy, </i>and became a crucial part of the fabric of the <i>Avengers </i>and <i>Star Wars </i>franchises. Just a few weeks before his death, he finished working on the upcoming film <i>The Batman </i>starring Robert Pattinson.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an Instagram post, the <i>Star Wars </i>actor John Boyega paid tribute to Jack, calling him “one of the most supportive people in our industry” and “a nurturer on set and the kind of person that was always up for an uplifting conversation.” —Andrew R.

Despite the ban on public gatherings, municipal authorities allowed Indigenous communities to gather and celebrate their beloved leader through dance and song, <a href=# rel=noopener>per his wishes</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kokama was born on September 19, 1966 in an Indigenous village in western Brazil. At 20, Kokama traveled a thousand miles down the river to Manaus, in search of greater opportunities. Instead, he found a society in which Indigenous people were marginalized, sleeping in the streets on the outskirts of the city, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>the New York <i>Times</i></a><i>.</i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kokama became determined to carve out a place for Indigenous people in Manaus. After becoming Chief of the Kokama tribe in 2012, Kokama founded Tribes Park, a community of houses in the city where approximately 700 families from 35 different Amazon Indigenous groups live, keeping alive their traditions and cultures, according to the <i>Times. </i>The project, which had been in the works for years, reportedly came to fruition when Kokama took it under his wing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Alongside this project, Kokama fought to make education accessible to Indigenous people, receiving his high school diploma at 40<b>.</b> He also advocated for greater access to health services, especially when the COVID-19 pandemic hit Indigenous communities, per the <i>Times</i>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the heart of Kokama’s work was a desire to reassert Indigenous culture into the fabric of Brazil’s identity.

So in 1974, Lee opened her own inclusive casting agency and embraced the struggle for Black African representation. Over 40-plus years as an agent and casting director, she worked on some of the biggest films in African history—from <i>Hotel Rwanda </i>to<i> Black Panther—</i>serving as a fierce intermediary between Hollywood and her homeland, and helping to change the perception of Africa around the world. On July 18, she died at 76 in Johannesburg from complications of the coronavirus.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Moonyeenn’s focus was on leveling the playing field in South Africa between Black and white actors, producers, and filmmakers,” Tony-winning actor John Kani says. “If it wasn’t for Moonyeenn’s efforts, we’d have a film industry that is not conscious of the changes that have taken place in this country.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lee was born in 1944 in Johannesburg and grew up around the stage, since her mother was a theater actress. But she didn’t want to go the same route: “I was a terrible actress,” she said in a<a href=# rel=noopener> 2017 interview</a>. Instead, she found a role behind the camera, starting her own agency, Moonyeenn Lee Associates, from her living room, recognizing and nurturing talent and using her charismatic force of nature to fight for local actors and stories.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After South Africa became a democracy in 1994, Lee took on a much bigger role on the international stage. She served as casting director for films like <i>In My Country</i>, <i>Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom </i>and <i>Tsotsi</i>, the last of which became the first South African film to win an Oscar. She became a member of both the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Television Academy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“She would travel around the world, introducing producers and directors to South African actors,” Nathi Mthethwa, the South African Minister of Arts and Culture, wrote in a<a href=# rel=noopener> statement</a> following her death. “She consistently did everything in her power to convince them to cast local actors over foreign actors and her dedication paid off.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As a judge on the talent discovery show <i>Class Act</i>, Lee became infamous for her scathing critiques of actors. She was quick to dissuade actors whom she felt weren’t ready to put in the work.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But when she chose to represent actors, she fought tooth and nail for them. Her clients over the years included some of South Africa’s highest-profile actors, including Winston Ntshona, Fana Mokoena, Tobie Cronjé and Kani. “Every movie I’ve done without her has been OK—but the ones that were critical to my career, I always got the call from Moonyeenn,” Kani says. That included a small part in <i>Captain America: Civil War </i>as King T’Chaka, which he was initially resistant to. “It wouldn’t have happened if Moonyeenn had not convinced me,” he says. Since then, Kani has secured a steady presence in the Disney and Marvel universes, with roles in <i>Black Panther</i> and <i>The Lion King</i>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kani says that in the first months of the coronavirus arriving in South Africa, Lee was extremely active in supporting out-of-work film artists and pushing for a better future. “She kept saying, ‘Let’s talk about what we can do in the interim so when the opening takes place, we are ready as artists to make our impact,” he says. “We felt very strongly that she was speaking for us. She will be sorely missed.” <i>—</i><i>Andrew Chow</i></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Ronald Lewis</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ronald-Lewis-obit.jpeg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ronald Lewis had long been a pillar of the New Orleans community as the owner and operator of the <a href=# rel=noopener>House of Dance and Feathers</a>, a museum that celebrates the city’s street culture and performance traditions.

That afternoon, Keheyas, who referred to Ljuljovic as “Big Sexy” in his phone, had planned to visit his pal at the condo Ljuljovic and his new wife had recently purchased in Westchester County. Ljuljovic followed up with a picture of a CVS thermometer, showing a 100.7 degree fever. “I think I have the normal flu,” he told Keheyas. Three hours later, however, his condition had taken a harsher turn. “Whatever this is it’s knocked me down like nothing ever has before,” Ljuljovic wrote to Kehayas, who shared this text exchange with TIME, at 5:46 p.m. that same day. “Getting from spot to spot is hard my body is drained.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The following Monday afternoon, March 23, Kehayas checked back in. “My body is killing me,” Ljuljovic responded.

He had fought for LGBTQ+ rights while living in Ireland and continued his activism in New York, where he met his husband, Juan Nepomuceno. He also spent decades advocating for disability rights and worked at A.H.R.C. New York City—a nonprofit that supports people with developmental disabilities—for nearly 35 years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He was a battering ram on issues of importance,” wrote Harriet Golden, vice president for program operations and innovation at A.H.R.C.

Anyone who faced him “recognized within moments that they were out of their league and it was time to wave the white flag of defeat.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He was also a warmhearted, “big burly bear of a man” who lit up any room he entered, says his friend and fellow activist Brendan Fay.

He had myasthenia gravis, a chronic neuromuscular disease, and had a surgery to remove a tumor from underneath his lung last fall. In late February, he traveled to New York to visit his college friends; when he returned, he reported flu-like symptoms and was admitted to a hospital, where he died. According to the BBC, the country’s health ministry said his pre-existing condition made him vulnerable to the disease.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His death was a warning to his nation, one final statement from a person who made it his mission to inform his fellow citizens and hold power to account. “He would easily tell a story in a very simple way for the ordinary person on the street,” Hakulandaba wrote, “and was speaking truth and facts to power.” —Andrew R.

But the songs written or co-written by Adam Schlesinger—for movies like <i>That Thing You Do!</i> and <i>Music and Lyrics</i>, for TV’s <i>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</i>, for the bands he was part of, including Fountains of Wayne and Ivy—always felt as if they’d been grown, not built, from the inside out. They changed shape as you listened to them, like flowers turning to the light; they could fill you with joy, but they often held within their petals just a hint of melancholy, that last-day-of-summer feeling that reminds you how precious it all is. Schlesinger, who died on April 1 at age 52, made his name in the age of the CD, but his songs resonate with the spirit of transistor radio, capturing the anticipation of waiting to hear a song you love, rather than choosing it from a Spotify playlist.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fountains of Wayne, the band Schlesinger formed with his frequent collaborator Chris Collingwood in 1995, did score a modest radio hit with the 2003 “Stacy’s Mom,” an ode to the charisma of older women. But the band’s work overall is a treasure trove of songs that are both clever and heartfelt, often ringing with internal rhymes but never at the expense of pure emotion. Schlesinger wrote songs filled with tenderness and question marks, from the power-pop moxie of “Red Dragon Tattoo,” the anxious hamster-wheeling of a man who’s just about to prove his love by getting major ink, to intimate observations of everyday life like “Sick Day,” a ballad about young women making the trek into Manhattan from Jersey or the outer boroughs, moving fast through their lives even as they still feel they’re waiting for them to begin. (It includes the line “Lead us not into Penn Station,” a miniature miracle of songcraft.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Schlesinger knew the power of a great pop song, and he poured all of that knowledge, all of that cotton-candy feeling, into the fake hit he wrote for a fake band, the title track to Tom Hanks’s 1996 <i>That Thing You Do!</i> In the movie, the song becomes a major hit for a bunch of kids who just happen to have formed a band. (They’re called The Wonders; the “One-Hit” is implied.) In the movie, “That Thing You Do” pours out of radios everywhere, and when people hear it, they stop short, they start dancing, they pick up on the lyrics and start singing along. “That Thing You Do” is inherently an inside joke, the super-catchy hit every songwriter wishes he could write. Yet it isn’t parody; it’s pure love, as if every Beatles or Kinks or Bacharach-David song Schlesinger ever heard had been filtered through his ears, through his brain, and then handed to us on a gleaming, spinning 45. That was Schlesinger’s genius: he held pop-music history for safekeeping by reweaving its threads into new and splendid and lasting pleasures. It’s got a backbeat, you can’t lose it. —Stephanie Zacharek</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Alison Schwartz</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Alison-Schwartz.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To know Alison Schwartz was to be a better person.

He was 70.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A far-left militant, Sepúlveda once served as a bodyguard to Chile’s socialist president Salvador Allende, who died by suicide during a military coup in 1973 and was replaced by the far-right dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. The regime imprisoned Sepúlveda for almost three years. After Amnesty International helped commute his sentence to exile in 1977, he traveled around Latin America, working with theater troupes, fighting alongside the leftist Sandinista movement to overthrow Nicaragua’s dictatorship, and spending a year living with the Shuar indigenous community in the Ecuadorian Amazon.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The latter experience informed his 1989 novel,<i> The Old Man Who Read Love Stories</i>. Sepúlveda’s story of colonizers encroaching on the rainforest and its people became a bestseller across Europe in the 1990s, and was translated into more than 30 languages. The author’s concern for the environment continued into activism with Greenpeace in defense of marine life, and more works that urged humans to rethink their relationship with nature.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sepúlveda settled in Spain in 1996 with his wife, Carmen Yáñez, also a writer and left-wing activist. He spent his final decades writing articles, novels and children’s books. Although he never moved back to Chile, he did not forget his militant roots. “I was always a writer, but when it was necessary to pick up a weapon, I picked one up,” he told Spanish newspaper <a href=# rel=noopener><i>La Vanguardia</i></a> in 2017. “I’m very much at peace with my past.

After coming to prominence in the early 1970s as a member of the comedic rock band The Drifters, Shimura headlined his own sketch-based series in the decades to come. This year, he had been chosen to carry the Olympic torch in July to represent his hometown of Higashimurayama, a Tokyo suburb. Not long before it was announced that the Olympics would be postponed, Shimura was taken to a Tokyo hospital and diagnosed with pneumonia. He was one of Japan’s first well-known figures to die from the virus.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Pretty much everyone under the age of 50 [in Japan] grew up with Ken Shimura,” Aaron Gerow, a professor of East Asian cinema and media at Yale University, tells TIME. “He was a dominant figure on television.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Born Yasunori Shimura in 1950, Shimura idolized Jerry Lewis and became a household name in the ‘70s and ‘80s, when The Drifters’ comedy television show <i>It’s 8 O’Clock, Gather Everyone!</i> became a major success. Over the next few decades he would perfect many slapstick routines, playing silly samurais, clumsy assassins, lecherous security guards, strange uncles and more. His variety show <i>Kato-Chan Ken-Chan Gokigen TV</i> was a direct precursor to <i>America’s Funniest Home Videos</i>, and he also led a comedy theater, Shimurakon (Shimura Spirit), beginning in 2006.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While Shimura mostly shed his risque brand of humor in his later years, he remained popular through his wildly popular animal-centric show, <i>Shimura Zoo</i>. On the show, he interacted with various animals and formed a particularly close relationship with one chimpanzee: “Pretty much everyone in the country knew Ken and his chimpanzee Pankun,” Peter Payne, the founder of the anime retailer J-List, wrote in a message.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The comedian Ike Nwala says that Shimura loomed large when Nwala moved from the U.S. to Japan in 2007 to start a career there. “He is definitely one of the pioneers of Japanese comedy,” Nwala says. “He used so many unique funny styles of makeup in his comedy acts, it makes it quite difficult for our generation of comedians to come up with something fresh and original, because people would always refer to the skits Mr. Shimura did back then.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For many in Japan, Shimura’s comedy was a simple fact of life. “I watched his program on TV when I was a child,” the soccer star Keisuke Honda<a href=# rel=noopener> wrote on Twitter</a>.

Jorge struggled under Fidel Castro’s rule, and in 1965 he fled with his family to the Florida Keys, settling in Hialeah, outside of Miami. He went on to become an accredited OB/GYN in the U.S. and delivered hundreds of babies during his 45-year practice.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Carlos, who was born in Cuba and came to the U.S. at age 2, grew up to become a doctor of internal medicine. He was a fan of the Miami Dolphins and loved traveling the world with his family.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Charlie believes his father contracted the virus while caring for COVID-19 patients. “He never hesitated to treat them. He did all he could to comfort them and be with them…he paid the ultimate price for what he did.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Vallejo family is already honoring the legacy left behind by Jorge and Carlos: Charlie is in his third year of medical school, and his younger brother has started his first year. They will be the fourth generation of physicians in the family.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I grew up looking at the type of man my grandfather was, and the way people just honored and respected my dad,” Charlie says. “They’re my two role models.

Inform all family and relatives to be on guard,” Li Wenliang typed into a chat group with his former medical school classmates on Dec. 30, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to</a> Caixin, a Beijing-based media group. Soon, Li’s message would resonate much farther. As the spiraling crisis emerged, he came to be known as the whistleblower of a virus that ultimately took his life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Not everyone appreciated Li’s bombshell warnings. After he shared information about the strange infections he was seeing, he was questioned and reprimanded by local police for “making untrue comments” and “severely disturbing social order.” His messages about a SARS-like infection conveyed an urgency that undercut the official efforts to downplay the epidemic and its risk to the public. At the time, Wuhan’s health bureau said there was <a href=# rel=noopener>no evidence of</a> spread between humans.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And yet Li was not dissuaded. He shared his ordeal online and carried out interviews with journalists through text message, conveying a picture of incompetence and mishandling of the virus at the crucial, initial stage of the outbreak. His insistence on speaking out defied a political system that does not tolerate dissent.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Before the coronavirus outbreak, Li was relatively unknown even within his hospital,<a href=# rel=noopener> according to</a> local media reports. Wu Yan, another doctor from the same department, said he hadn’t heard of Li before news broke about authorities censoring discussion of the virus. Following Li’s death, he has been heralded as a hero across China, and police in Wuhan have apologized to his family.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“All I know is that he spoke the truth,” Wu said, “and said things many people wouldn’t dare to.” —Hillary Leung</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Wiwit Widarto</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Wiwit-Widarto-obit.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Wiwit Widarto, a crew member on the <a href=#>coronavirus-stricken cruise ship <i>MS</i> <i>Zaandam</i></a>, reportedly died from complications of the virus on April 8. He was 50.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a statement to TIME, the <i>Zaandam</i>’s operator, Holland America Line, confirmed that a crew member had passed away and said the cruise line was “working to assist the family.” “Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time,” the statement continued.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A former colleague of Widarto (whose name TIME is withholding to protect their employment) says Widarto is survived by a wife and two sons. When asked to describe Widarto, they put it simply: “A good human.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Widarto, an Indonesian national, had tested positive for the virus and was hospitalized when the ship docked in Florida on April 2 after spending weeks at sea negotiating a place to dock, <a href=# rel=noopener>the <i>Associated Press</i> reported.</a> After an outbreak of coronavirus spread onboard the <i>Zaandam</i> — which was originally scheduled to sail from Argentina to Florida — multiple South American countries rejected the ship’s request to dock. By April 2, 107 guests and 143 crew members had reported “flu-like symptoms” and nine passengers aboard tested positive for COVID-19. Four elderly passengers died aboard the ship, three of whom had reportedly tested positive for COVID-19.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A second former colleague of Widarto’s, who worked with him on board the <i>Zaandam,</i> described him as a “very good and quiet guy” in a message to TIME.

On April 8, Wilkerson died at the age of 72 from complications of the coronavirus after more than a week in the hospital.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I receive a lot of male attention, but Will is more special than all the rest,” Franklin<a href=# rel=noopener> said in 2012</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Wilkerson was born in 1947 and grew up on the East Side of Detroit. “He always had a job: He worked at the candy store and the barbershop, and he was a paperboy,” Sandra Evangelista, his daughter, told TIME. He served in the Vietnam War; upon his return he became a fire engine operator in Detroit while also running a cab company.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Reginald Amos, a retired deputy fire chief,<a href=# rel=noopener> told the Detroit News</a> that Wilkerson was “one of the best, if not the best, we had on the department at that time.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He served the citizens of the city of Detroit admirably, and he never turned his back on the city or its citizens,” Amos said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The circumstances of Wilkerson and Franklin’s fateful meeting on the Detroit waterfront are somewhat contested. At the time, Franklin had been married and divorced twice; Wilkerson had three daughters from a previous relationship. <i>Jet</i> Magazine, in 1987, framed the encounter as Wilkerson asking Franklin for her autograph. Wilkerson later said it was the opposite: “He told me that she came up to him and wanted to sign his cast,” Evangelista said. “He had no idea who she was until after she had signed it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Regardless of who approached whom, the pair bonded quickly. Wilkerson made a cameo in Franklin’s 1986 video <a href=# rel=noopener>“Jimmy Lee.”</a> Franklin, in the same <i>Jet</i> article, <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> of their relationship that “it makes you feel wonderful, like a year younger.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1994, Wilkerson<a href=# rel=noopener> said</a> in a <i>Vanity Fair</i> article that he and Franklin had been briefly engaged. They didn’t marry, though he became her road manager and handled security for her tours. In 2012, they became engaged and unengaged again, but remained close.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We’re very compatible, and he supports me and I support him a lot, and he has given me specialized attention that I don’t think I’ve received from anyone else,” Franklin said that year.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Wilkerson had retired from his firefighter post in 1995; in the last decades of his life, he traveled the world with Franklin, meeting Barack Obama at his inauguration in 2008 and playing plenty of golf. And, perhaps unsurprisingly given his profession, his role as a father sometimes manifested in heroic ways.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“My father literally saved my life twice by getting to my house faster than the ambulance and getting me to the hospital,” Tequila Wilkerson, his daughter, told TIME. “He was my best friend, and the best father a girl could ever ask for.” <i>—Andrew R.

Wilson, the zoo’s first Black senior zookeeper, knew just the solution. Without hesitation, Wilson walked into the front of the habitat and calmly called out for him while holding some apples, a favorite treat. It wasn’t long before Junior obediently returned.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“You couldn’t be around her for even just a couple of minutes and not notice that the lady was just trying to be compassionate, but confident,” says Mike McClure, who worked under Wilson for many years. “I think that also influenced how she interacted with the animals.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After more than two weeks in the hospital, Wilson died on May 21 due to complications of the coronavirus. She was 83.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Wilson began her zoo career at age 23. Arthur Watson, who led the zoo during Wilson’s hire, once <a href=# rel=noopener>told the Baltimore <i>Sun</i></a> Wilson’s only qualifications were a “willingness to work hard and a love of animals. In these days of specialized training, she probably wouldn’t get past the front door.” Wilson would eventually become no stranger to breaking barriers: Undeterred by her lack of formal training, she excelled at working with big mammals.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“She just always had a nice calm about her,” says McClure. “It was really nice as somebody coming up in the field to be able to have that support.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Wilson retired from the zoo in the late ‘90s, but would often still attend meet-ups they hosted. Yet Sharron Wilson Jackson, Wilson’s daughter, told <a href=# rel=noopener>the <i>Sun</i></a> that as the years passed her mother “started showing that she had Alzheimer’s disease, but was still physically good and very strong.” McClure says Wilson still went for miles-long walks around her neighborhood almost until the end.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Those close to Wilson noted that her legacy is her ability to respect all creatures as they are.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“They weren’t dumb animals there for her entertainment,” McClure says. “Mary really treated them like equals.” <i>—</i><i>Nadia Suleman</i></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Marny Xiong</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Xiong-Marny-covid-obit.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Those who knew Marny Xiong remember her as a loving sister, a community leader and a champion for public education. “She was beautiful,” her family said in a <a href=# rel=noopener>statement</a>. “She was a book of generosity and fire.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Xiong, chairwoman of the St. Paul Board of Education in Minnesota, died on June 7, a month after she was hospitalized for the coronavirus.
