She isn’t yet seeing plastic people, shadow men or transparent spiders–just three of the fabled hallucinations of the Billings, Mont., crank scene, a hyperstimulated subculture sickeningly rich in slang and folklore. But she is feeling pangs of remorse about her three-year-old. On Monday, when she left her parents’ house, where she has been living since dropping out of college, she promised the daughter she calls “my angel” that Mommy would be right back. Sadly, though, crank squeezes time like an accordion, and since Jennifer swore her solemn maternal oath, approximately 100 hours have passed in a sleepless, virtually food-free blur of hurried parking-lot drug deals, marathon bouts at the video poker machine and frantic cigarette runs to the mini-mart.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now, perched at the bar of a downtown dance club where her dealer boyfriend ditched her ages ago with just $4 for drinks, Jennifer scratches at her wrists and elbows; her eyes dart from pool table to door; and her butt compulsively scoots around inside her baggy jeans. Crank kills the appetite, just wipes it out, and while many women she knows view this as a selling point, Jennifer doesn’t want to lose more weight. Hoping to supplement the child-support check that turns to drugs the day it hits her mailbox, she’d applied for a job as a cocktail waitress, but her meth-shrunken breasts didn’t fill the skimpy costume.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This drug makes you lose everything,” she says, gulping a shot of bourbon and root-beer schnapps to calm her freaking neurotransmitters. “I’m not afraid, though. I’ve cranked for seven years,” Jennifer says. (Her name has been changed by TIME, as have the names and various identifying details of other crank users cited.) “I’m getting pretty used to losing everything.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All over Billings (pop. 91,000), the scrappy hub city of the northwestern Great Plains, home to oil refineries, regional medical centers and countless smoke-filled fistfight barrooms where cowboys from Wyoming to South Dakota come for some urban R. and R., people are losing everything to crank–their families, their jobs, their homes, their bank accounts and, perhaps irretrievably, their minds. The potent, man-made stimulant–invented 80 years ago in Japan, issued to soldiers in World War II, prescribed to chunky housewives in the ’50s, known to ’60s hippies as speed and now sometimes passed out to antsy third-graders with attention-deficit disorder–is, at least in its crumbly, powdered street form, an upper that leads straight down.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This isn’t the carefully calibrated dose of methamphetamine dispensed by pharmacists in pill form. This is crank–smoked, snorted or injected–and it makes people live like coyotes, says a cop standing outside a south-side Billings bungalow while agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration toss the place for drugs. “This town is coming unhinged,” another cop says. As if to prove their point, the suspected crank house whose street-side picture windows are sheathed with tinfoil (sunlight is the cranker’s natural enemy) starts belching evidence of criminal lunacy–hypodermic needles clogged with meth, automatic pistols of several calibers and an AK-47 with a loaded 100-round clip.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Next come the makings for amateur bombs: jars of gunpowder, lengths of pipe and a homemade blasting cap fashioned from fuse cord and a rifle shell. Given crank’s capacity for rendering even casual users clinically psychotic (the transparent spiders weave webs inside the brain long after the meth has left one’s system), the arsenal is probably unnecessary, real weapons amassed for a figmentary showdown.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Marijuana and cocaine were this city’s illegal substances of choice until about four years ago, when a blizzard of crank swept in. “It’s pretty much all we deal with now,” says Sergeant Tim O’Connell, who heads the city’s multiagency drug task force. For law enforcers, methamphetamine is a tough drug to pin down. It’s sold hand to hand behind closed doors, in homes and motel rooms, in the style of a Tupperware party. Worse, its production requires little overhead. Ephedrine, an over-the-counter cold medication, can be combined with a shopping list of chemicals easily obtained from stores and industrial-supply companies (common drain cleaners figure in some formulas) and cooked in a kitchen sink from recipes downloaded from the Internet. Billings cops call these homely setups “Beavis and Butt-head labs.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Why crank? And why now? The crank epidemic is new enough, and its mostly white, often rural victims quiet enough, that those questions are just starting to be asked. “The current culture is ‘Keep going, keep moving and do it all.’ That would be the initial draw, I think,” says Nancy Waite-O’Brien, Ph.D., director of psychological services at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif. Add to this the wannabe-supermodel factor. “Women,” observes Waite-O’Brien, “get into meth because they think it will manage weight. Which I suppose it sometimes does–at first.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">American drug warriors, welcome to your nightmare–a do-it-yourself guerrilla narcotic spread by paranoid insomniacs who think they see federal agents through every keyhole, even when it’s just the Domino’s Pizza man. In cities large and small across the West and Midwest crank belt, from Oregon to Iowa, where the drug is known as the poor man’s cocaine in towns that barely had cocaine in the first place, the drug arrives nonstop from every direction and by every imaginable route. Wrapped by the ounce and the pound in duct-tape eggs that can be stashed in the air vent of a car, crank comes up the interstate from California and Mexico, where it’s produced in massive quantities by organized criminal gangs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sometimes it even comes by UPS. In one of Billings’ biggest recent crank seizures, O’Connell, wearing the company’s brown uniform, intercepted a 5-lb. package at the UPS warehouse one morning (street value: a quarter of a million dollars) and delivered it to the address on the label. The men who answered the doorbell were arrested. Dennis Paxinos, the Yellowstone County attorney, requested that the men’s bail be set at $250,000, but the judge involved reduced the sum to a mere $1,000. Paxinos publicly called the decision “asinine.” Within a few hours of his release, one of the suspects was back in jail on another charge.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A lot of Billings crank has to travel no farther than across the street, from the apartment building where it’s made to the tavern or motel room where it’s sold. So pervasive is this bathtub crank that a Billings teenager trying to kick drugs had to quit her job as a hotel maid because she was constantly finding traces of meth in the bathrooms she cleaned. While on assignment for this story, TIME’s writer and photographer watched from the lobby of their motel as a notorious Billings crank dealer, facing state charges at the time, received a steady stream of predawn customers in a room directly across the courtyard. (“You know he’s in,” the night clerk said, “when the phone lines all light up at once.”) Approached for an interview about his trade, the wanted man, a tattooed giant on a bed surrounded by a clutch of weary party girls, merely said, “I’m busy. I don’t have time now.” Last week the alleged dealer was arrested in another Billings motel in a raid that netted several ounces of what police identified as meth. Said a motel employee about her fugitive lodger: “The only problem is that when he leaves, the mirrors in his room are always broken and all the light bulbs are missing.” (Lokers without a pipe at hand typically smoke crank from a broken light bulb.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“How are you going to cut off the supply of something you can produce at home?” asks Mona Sumner, chief operations officer of the Rimrock Foundation, Billings’ (and Montana’s) largest drug-rehab facility. Sumner, in her 30 years at Rimrock, has seen many a drug craze come and go, but she has never felt this frightened or frustrated. Crank admissions to her facility have tripled in the past four years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Crank is too cheap, too available and too addictive, Sumner says. “Honestly, I don’t know where it’s going.” The crankers who show up at the clinic require, on average, four weeks of detox, often with the use of antipsychotic drugs, before the counselors can even get through to them. On a wall in the Rimrock recreation room hangs a homemade poster showing a medevac helicopter like those that land at nearby St. Vincent Hospital. The poster is intended to reassure paranoid recovering crankers, but many are so unstrung that they fear the helicopter is after them.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Delusions about sinister aircraft are among the milder symptoms of the Billings area’s mounting crank plague. East on Interstate 90, in the town of Livingston, the body of a young woman, Angela Brown, was found rotting in a river, and local law-enforcement officials are investigating a Billings meth connection. A few months earlier, south of Billings, in Hardin, an admittedly cranked-out 17-year-old, Jonathan Wayne Vandersloot, whose head hadn’t touched a pillow in days, allegedly shot dead his sleeping grandparents, scooped up some jewelry, guns and cash, and took off in their pickup. Vandersloot’s first trial ended in a hung jury. Prosecutors plan to retry him this fall.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Farther south, crank has decimated the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, populated by descendants of the warriors who routed Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. “Crank will do to the reservations what Custer couldn’t,” says Bonnie Pipe, clinical director of a tribal recovery center in the town of Lame Deer. When James Walksalong, chairman of the local school board, brought in a team of drug-sniffing dogs last year, kids climbed out of classroom windows, and by the end of the day the dogs had detected 30 instances of drug residue. On reservations throughout Montana and Wyoming, the drug has led to increased domestic abuse, a flurry of audacious daylight burglaries and overloaded medical facilities.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">David Morales, a truant officer for Billings School District 2 and a recovering addict, deals with the meth problem too often in the form of 10- and 11-year-olds either on the drug or suffering abuse at the hands of spun-out relatives. “I call them the ghost children,” he says. “I see them all the time.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Recently Morales called into his office a beautiful little six-year-old girl who had been missing a lot of school. “I asked her if she needed an alarm clock to help her wake up on time,” he recalls, “and all of a sudden she breaks down crying.” It seems that under the nose of her allegedly crank-addicted mother, the girl had been raped repeatedly by a teenage relative, a sadistic sort given to dousing his hands in fingernail-polish remover, setting them aflame and then blowing out the fire before he was burned. He warned the girl that he would ignite her if she spoke out. Morales tells of another girl, 11, whose meth-crazed mother prostituted her for a onetime windfall of $360. The girl thought this was normal life, Morales says. Mom needed the money.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The E.R. doctors at Deaconess Billings clinic have their own ugly tales to tell. The crank casualties who appear in the E.R. break down into three basic types, according to Dr. Larry McEvoy, who heads the emergency-medicine department: “First there’s the ‘I’ve hit bottom’ presentation. They’ve used for 10 days, haven’t eaten or slept and have run out of drugs. They’re wiped out, feel heavy and can hardly move. Type 2 is the acute public-disturbance person. They start fighting with people or screaming in the street. Often they’re impossible to interview because they’re so paranoid. Third are people who use crank a lot and notice that their arms are numb or they’re having trouble breathing.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">McEvoy has seen a radical increase in all three types: “The amounts we see are overwhelming. As a physician, I regard it as the worst possible drug. It really burns people out.” And it can do so almost instantly, in McEvoy’s experience.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“One night a boy came in so out of control he thought I was the police and the police were trying to kill or kidnap him. He was incredibly violent–biting, slapping, grabbing doctors’ private parts. We got hold of his folks and found out he’s usually a good student. Even if he does this only once every two years, given his psychotic reaction to the drug, he could end up killing someone.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’ve seen 14-year-old girls with infected arms who have been stuck a bunch of times by people who aren’t very good at hitting veins. And I’m frequently surprised by the number of people who don’t use it every day but don’t feel bad about dabbling in it. They seem to be unaware of the precipice they’re hanging over.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Janet Cousrouf, Rimrock’s director of nursing, says crank carries with it almost a two-week residue of paranoia. “Since the detox time is longer than most companies are willing to pay for, our biggest problem is insurance.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cousrouf frankly despairs about the crank plague and in particular its spread from generation to generation. “A lot of the crankers are products of crank mothers, or they have fetal alcohol syndrome. And we’re seeing a whole new era of fetal drug syndrome–underdeveloped brain stems, SIDS deaths.” Cousrouf believes crank is one of the main culprits in these cases.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But from their sober point of view, doctors and nurses can tell you only so much. The best way to see what crank has done to Billings–and perhaps understand the appeal of a drug made from drain-cleaning crystals–is to spend time with crankers, both active and reformed. A group of them loiter outside the Montana Rescue Mission, a private Christian charity that offers a bed to crash in and, if they choose, a religion-based recovery program, Reality and Christ.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tom, 24, a husky blond kid who says he has been drug free for 17 days, is fresh out of jail for stealing a handgun he planned to sell for drug cash. The gun belonged to his girlfriend’s father, who happened to be a deputy sheriff. “How dumb can you get?” Tom asks. After flashing a driver’s license photo to show how much thinner he was in his meth days, Tom effuses about his newfound love of Christ. A few minutes later he reaches into his jeans jacket and pulls out a scorched, homemade glass crank pipe.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“To be honest,” he says, “if I had some now, I’d smoke it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Huddled on the ground against a wall, Justin and Kim, 24 and 18, scoff at Tom’s pipe. They’re bangers–they shoot their crank–and anyone who does different is crazy, they say. “We’ve been off it 11 days,” says Justin. “I’m trying to get my tolerance back down so it won’t take me so much to get spun out,” he explains. As narcotics go, crank is famously cheap–a $20 bundle keeps you buzzing for up to 12 jaw-grinding, heart-pounding hours–but frequent users still have trouble affording it. For one thing, they tend to get grandiose while high. A recovering addict (in his one year of crank use, he went from reigning as high school homecoming king to serving a robbery sentence in a state penitentiary) remembers buying drinks for the house every time he set foot in a strange bar.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When asked how he’s staying away from the needle, Justin produces a plastic medicine dropper and pokes his arm with it. “Calms me down,” he says. “I quit smoking the same way, by sucking on a crayon.” Like so many other Billings geeters–yet one more slang term–Justin is a teller of wild tales. He shows off the sunken veins in his arms and describes how he once had to gaff his shot of crank–inject it straight into his jugular vein–while watching himself in a rearview mirror. “The jugular,” he says, nodding earnestly, “the only vein in the body that won’t roll over on you.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hovering in the mission’s doorway, a sweatshirt hood drawn over his pale, thin face, is Dracula. That’s what the others call him, and he answers to it. Trembling, high and radically withdrawn, Dracula refuses to speak a word, but he does show off an arm full of tattoos. The intricate, dense, almost abstract blue-green filigree seems to say, “This is your brain on crank.” The next show-and-tell item is the eyeglass case in which Dracula keeps his syringe and razor blade. The case’s interior is obsessively decoupaged with tiny, interlocking pictures snipped from magazines.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dracula is a great artist, Justin says, and if art is defined as manic patternmaking for no apparent purpose, he’s right.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Across town, at a table in the modest apartment where she supposes she’ll have to go on living until she finds a job, Alicia is quitting crank. Once an upwardly mobile employee of a FORTUNE 500 company based in a large Southwestern city, Alicia is in her mid-30s but looks 50. Her face is pocked and pitted from her attempts to pick out the crystals of methamphetamine that, she swears, used to form under her skin. Alicia moved to Montana several years ago in hopes of escaping the bigger city’s crank scene. She says the subcutaneous crystals aren’t a problem now; the Billings meth is not so pure. Not that it matters, because she’s quitting.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tomorrow.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Right now, however, she’s lighting one last pipeful in a ritual as intricate as a Japanese tea ceremony. She ignites a propane torch and holds the blue flame beneath the smudge of powder in her clear glass pipe. Crank is smoked differently than crack cocaine; it takes less heat and melts instantly (burning away the impurities, Alicia says). Once the drug vaporizes in a white cloud, Alicia inhales. She then repeats the process. The residues in the pipe, called frosties, are infinitely valuable to crankers, and Alicia keeps torching them until they’re gone.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But such solitary crank use isn’t the norm in Billings. Crank is a party drug here, a social thing, smoked, injected and snorted by tight-knit groups holed up in houses behind blacked-out windows, talking nonstop about their hopes and dreams and smoking a joint now and then or drinking a beer to mellow out the high.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“You think you’re with your best friends in the whole world,” remembers the toppled homecoming king. “You stay up all night saying things like ‘Man, I’d die for you,’ and then in the morning everybody crashes and you realize you hate these people. They disgust you.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Paula, 19, who has been clean for six months following a stay at Rimrock, remembers crank parties as surreal blendings of light and darkness, reality and dreams. “The sun goes up and down and you lose track, and pretty soon you’re hearing laughs and whispers and seeing things dart around on the floor. Then the other people turn into monsters.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Boyish, sardonic and stunningly intelligent, Paula, who has never been anywhere else, calls Billings the crank capital of the universe: “The people in my neighborhood all learned crank from their parents. I mostly hung out with 13- and 14-year-olds. It’s getting younger and younger every year.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Part of crank’s appeal to Paula, and apparently to most users, is that it helped her get things done. It made her feel capable, on top of things. She could party into the wee hours (often having sex with virtual strangers because, as she puts it, once you’ve stayed up all night with someone, you feel pretty close to them), go to work the next day, then come home and clean her room. “I even started depending on it to go to school,” she says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Then came what Paula claims was a three-month-long, nearly sleepless crank run that left her homeless, expelled from school and seeing ghouls behind every tree. Crankers tend to exaggerate, but her memories of the streak have that patented methamphetamine exactitude. “I knew I had to get nutrition, so every day I had a pudding snack, an applesauce and a little carton of milk,” she says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Her diet wasn’t all so wholesome, though. “Also, I was smoking tons of pot just to calm my nerves.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For Jennifer, the conscience-stricken mother, the party’s still not over. Another crank-warped week has passed; another Friday night has rolled around; and though she’s thinner, paler and less coherent, she’s feeling considerably richer owing to the arrival this morning of her monthly child-support check. Swaying nautically on her favorite barstool, she reports that she has made some changes in her life in the past few days. She’s moved out of her parents’ place, leaving her daughter behind, and has taken up residence in a rented house with two male roommates who share her taste for meth and, unlike her family, don’t “make me feel guilty every time they look at me.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That’s where the party continues when the bars close. The tiny house, across the tracks and across the freeway, is supernaturally tidy. In the spotless kitchen, at a spotless table next to a box filled with hundreds of empty beer cans all conscientiously rinsed and crushed (when crankers decide to clean house, they clean house), Jennifer and her roommates smoke and jabber while clock hands turn from 3 to 4 to 5.
