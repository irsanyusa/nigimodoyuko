I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;change my&nbsp;life based on&nbsp;your <a href=# title=lifestyle data-link=tag>lifestyle</a>!’</p><p>Wow. I&nbsp;began to&nbsp;wonder&nbsp;— do&nbsp;I actually have a&nbsp;specific "lifestyle"? Well, it&nbsp;seems I&nbsp;have! And straight away&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;put it&nbsp;into words, setting it&nbsp;out logically point by&nbsp;point. And it&nbsp;actually turns out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;ridiculously simple. I&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;putting it&nbsp;into four sections&nbsp;— one a&nbsp;week. That’s just one month of&nbsp;independent work in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;change your life for the better!</p><p>So, for every week there’s a&nbsp;plan made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;three tasks, which you need to&nbsp;incorporate into your life and keep doing for the rest of&nbsp;the month. Ideally, you should continue doing them even after this, but that’s for you to&nbsp;decide.</p><p><h2><strong>Week&nbsp;1:</strong> Purifying your mind and body</h2></p><li><strong>An&nbsp;early start</strong>, around 6&nbsp;am. This is&nbsp;when you’ll find the time for yourself which you never have enough of&nbsp;during the day. You’ll find it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;period of&nbsp;peace and quiet, when you’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;sort out various things which you need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;without being distracted, because everyone else is&nbsp;still asleep. This an&nbsp;ideal time for morning exercises, which will help prepare you for living the upcoming day to&nbsp;the max. Feeling lazy and a&nbsp;reluctance to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;bed early really aren’t an&nbsp;indication that you are tired. In&nbsp;my&nbsp;opinion, this shows that you don’t really want to&nbsp;live your own life. What’s the point in&nbsp;getting out of&nbsp;bed, when it’ll just be&nbsp;the same depressing weather, the subway, traffic, work...But what&nbsp;if, instead of&nbsp;this mentality, you realised another great day is&nbsp;coming&nbsp;up, and your first thought when you woke up&nbsp;was ’roll on&nbsp;the morning!’? Admit it&nbsp;— if&nbsp;you felt like this, getting up&nbsp;early would hardly be&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem. This is&nbsp;just simple logic. If&nbsp;you’re living life to&nbsp;the full, you’ll want to&nbsp;jump out of&nbsp;bed. Or&nbsp;viewed the other way round&nbsp;— if&nbsp;you jump out of&nbsp;bed in&nbsp;the morning, life will begin to&nbsp;burn more brightly!</li><li><strong>Better nutrition</strong>. The upcoming changes will demand a&nbsp;tremendous amount of&nbsp;energy from you. Most likely, you’re currently using up&nbsp;most of&nbsp;your energy on&nbsp;keeping your body functioning in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;the effects of&nbsp;alcohol, cigarettes, and heavy, fatty or&nbsp;otherwise unhealthy food. Each of&nbsp;us has our own personal set of&nbsp;such vices which we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;own up&nbsp;to. Or&nbsp;rather, we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;overcome them. You can choose whichever kind of&nbsp;diet seems right to&nbsp;you. Personally, I’m vegetarian and believe in&nbsp;eating uncooked food. But there’s one thing which&nbsp;I know applies to&nbsp;all of&nbsp;us: alcohol, potato chips, sugary drinks, pre-prepared meals, junk food&nbsp;— none of&nbsp;these things fit into anyone’s idea of&nbsp;healthy eating. Therefore, you should cut all of&nbsp;these things out of&nbsp;your diet. Also, reduce the size of&nbsp;the portions you eat, and don’t fill up&nbsp;before you go&nbsp;to&nbsp;bed. In&nbsp;other respects, just listen to&nbsp;what your own body is&nbsp;telling you, or&nbsp;take some advice from a&nbsp;dietician. The most important thing, though, is&nbsp;to&nbsp;avoid burdening yourself with toxins. Instead, you need to&nbsp;ease the plight of&nbsp;your body as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible by&nbsp;eating light, healthy, tasty food. You’ll be&nbsp;happier and have more energy needed for an&nbsp;active lifestyle.</li><li><strong>Sport. </strong>I&nbsp;love sport and for me&nbsp;it’s absolutely mandatory. I&nbsp;never tire of&nbsp;saying that keeping one’s body well-toned and healthy is&nbsp;vital for one’s spiritual health. To&nbsp;shake some life out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;tired body, you need to&nbsp;shake your body itself! And by&nbsp;any method which seems right for you. I&nbsp;like yoga, running and dancing. Try to&nbsp;move around a&nbsp;lot more every day, in&nbsp;any way you can&nbsp;— dance in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the mirror when you’re getting ready for work; take a&nbsp;pass on&nbsp;the elevator in&nbsp;favour of&nbsp;the stairs; establish a&nbsp;full workout for yourself at&nbsp;the gym.</li><p><h2><strong>Week&nbsp;2</strong>: Putting your private life in&nbsp;order</h2></p><li><strong>Clean up&nbsp;your <a href=# title="personal space" data-link=tag>personal space</a></strong>. Throw out everything! It’s time to&nbsp;bring order to&nbsp;every corner, table and cupboard in&nbsp;your home (stuffing things in&nbsp;the attic doesn’t count). Think about&nbsp;it: every single object in&nbsp;your house&nbsp;— even the smallest&nbsp;— not only takes up&nbsp;space, but also consumes some of&nbsp;your energy. Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;really worth holding on&nbsp;to&nbsp;it? I&nbsp;became so&nbsp;keen on&nbsp;this method that&nbsp;I threw almost all of&nbsp;my&nbsp;things out in&nbsp;the trash. Keep only stuff which really is&nbsp;useful or&nbsp;you actually need, which makes you happy, or&nbsp;which you most cherish. One other thing&nbsp;— if&nbsp;up&nbsp;till now you’ve kept that teddy bear which your lover gave you for Valentines Day in&nbsp;1998, but you already broke up&nbsp;with them a&nbsp;long time ago, then you don’t need such ’happy’ memories any more. Rid yourself of&nbsp;it, without hesitation. Once you’ve done all this, you’ll find that you feel a&nbsp;whole lot better. Especially if&nbsp;you wipe up&nbsp;the dust everywhere, and wash the floors.</li><li><strong>Sort out your personal business; fulfil your obligations</strong>. Do&nbsp;you remember how many years it&nbsp;is&nbsp;that you’ve been planning to&nbsp;learn Spanish? And how many times have you promised to&nbsp;drive up&nbsp;to&nbsp;visit your grandparents on&nbsp;the East Coast? How many of&nbsp;your New Year’s resolutions have you been transferring from the old to&nbsp;the new list, already for years on&nbsp;end? You need to&nbsp;remind yourself of&nbsp;all the promises which you’ve made to&nbsp;yourself and to&nbsp;others, and decide how you’re going to&nbsp;deal with them. You essentially have two options: (1) fulfil them, or&nbsp;(2) striking them from your ’to do’ list forever. But if&nbsp;you can’t give up&nbsp;on&nbsp;your grandparents, of&nbsp;course, then go&nbsp;tomorrow. Do&nbsp;what you need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;dragging around those feelings of&nbsp;obligation and disappointment in&nbsp;yourself.</li><li><strong>Sort out your social life</strong>. Break off any relationships which you feel pull you backwards or&nbsp;make you depressed. Give up&nbsp;talking to&nbsp;all those who have a&nbsp;negative outlook, who are arrogant, and with whom you have nothing in&nbsp;common. Learn to&nbsp;just walk away, and to&nbsp;say&nbsp;no. Allow yourself to&nbsp;be&nbsp;ungrateful, ill-mannered, to&nbsp;act crazy, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;unpleasant&nbsp;— if&nbsp;that’s what it&nbsp;takes to&nbsp;feel free. The only exception to&nbsp;all this should be&nbsp;your parents. In&nbsp;my&nbsp;view, you absolutely have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;good terms with them, even if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;hard work.</li><p><h2><strong>Week&nbsp;3</strong>: Plans, goals and dreams</h2></p><li><strong>Write down, and then carry out your plans</strong>. It&nbsp;seems we’ve ended up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;tasks to&nbsp;do&nbsp;from last week. How does this make you feel? Do&nbsp;you feel happy and enthusiastic about this? Are you rolling up&nbsp;your sleeves in&nbsp;anticipation? If&nbsp;the answer’s no, then maybe it’s worth striking off a&nbsp;few more things. Or&nbsp;alternatively, actually carry them out, and then strike them off. In&nbsp;both cases though, the result that awaits you is&nbsp;a&nbsp;surge in&nbsp;strength and a&nbsp;renewed thirst for life. Remember, what is&nbsp;it&nbsp;that you love or&nbsp;at&nbsp;some point used to&nbsp;love doing? Don’t forget that you should not only be&nbsp;taking your work and financial obligations seriously, but also plan your free time&nbsp;— so&nbsp;you can relax, see friends and loved ones, and (this is&nbsp;the one every one always forgets) find time for yourself. You should write the kind of&nbsp;plan that you’ll be&nbsp;itching to&nbsp;get started&nbsp;on. Write it&nbsp;out all in&nbsp;one&nbsp;go, and don’t forget to&nbsp;include specific deadlines and steps to&nbsp;take. Imagine the story of&nbsp;your life is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the subject of&nbsp;a&nbsp;book; it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;one you would want to&nbsp;read yourself.</li><li><strong>List your most implausible dreams</strong>. This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;absolute favourite things to&nbsp;do. I&nbsp;do this exercise regularly, and each time my&nbsp;ideas become even more ridiculous. You have to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;all those things you dream of&nbsp;doing, but which is&nbsp;so&nbsp;implausible that you know it&nbsp;will absolutely never happen. This might include becoming ruler of&nbsp;the world or&nbsp;climbing Mount Everest when you’re 89. Ignore the sensible voice in&nbsp;your head ,and imagine that the world is&nbsp;your oyster; all you have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;click your fingers. You have all the time, money, connections, and talent that you need. What would you&nbsp;do? By&nbsp;the way, my&nbsp;first list of&nbsp;pipe-dreams of&nbsp;this kind, which&nbsp;I wrote back in&nbsp;February 2014, has now been completely realised in&nbsp;its entirety. And now&nbsp;I find it&nbsp;funny that my&nbsp;wishes were so&nbsp;modest, but at&nbsp;the time they seemed impossible to&nbsp;achieve.</li><li><b>Plan things on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis</b>. Write a&nbsp;plan for the next day every evening. It&nbsp;doesn’t matter whether it’s short, or&nbsp;only a&nbsp;rough plan&nbsp;— it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;any kind of&nbsp;plan as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;you’ve written&nbsp;it. And it’s important to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;specifically in&nbsp;the evening. Even if&nbsp;you don’t remember anything from it&nbsp;the next day, you’ll be&nbsp;more productive. This has been tried and tested! Moreover, don’t forget to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;your overall plan and ask yourself where you’re going in&nbsp;life. Are you going anywhere at&nbsp;all?</li><p><h2><strong>Week&nbsp;4:</strong> Expand your horizons</h2></p><li><b>Try to&nbsp;live differently</b>. Even the smallest things can have an&nbsp;effect. Take a&nbsp;different route to&nbsp;work. Drop into a&nbsp;cafe where you’ve never been before, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;very expensive shop. Try a&nbsp;new kind of&nbsp;sport. Try doing what you’ve never done before. And every day, when you’re busy with stuff you’re used to&nbsp;doing all the time, ask yourself the question&nbsp;— what can I&nbsp;do a&nbsp;little differently right now? You need to&nbsp;get into the habit of&nbsp;trying something new; that way you’ll gradually get off the beaten track.</li><li><strong>Get out of&nbsp;your comfort zone</strong>. Of&nbsp;course, if&nbsp;you’ve managed to&nbsp;carry out all the previous steps, you’ve already advanced a&nbsp;long way out of&nbsp;your comfort zone. But you need to&nbsp;go&nbsp;further and look your biggest fears in&nbsp;the eyes. And not only look at&nbsp;them, but also do&nbsp;battle with them. On&nbsp;this subject, I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;proponent of&nbsp;radical methods. Scared of&nbsp;heights? Go&nbsp;skydiving. Terrified of&nbsp;your boss? Go&nbsp;to&nbsp;him alone with a&nbsp;new project proposal. If&nbsp;you dread meeting new people, head to&nbsp;a&nbsp;party where you don’t know anyone else (and go&nbsp;on&nbsp;your own, so&nbsp;you can’t talk to&nbsp;your friend all night). We&nbsp;learn new things and develop in&nbsp;these kinds of&nbsp;situations.</li><li><b>Take a&nbsp;break</b>. You thought what? This is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;all hard work? Only ’taking a&nbsp;break’ here means that you have to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;the house, turn off the Wi-Fi connection, and spend some time alone. It&nbsp;also means giving yourself some honest feedback. What was this past month like for you? How did it&nbsp;all&nbsp;go, what changes occurred in&nbsp;your life? And how will you carry on&nbsp;and go&nbsp;further now that it’s over?</li><p>The things which await you as&nbsp;you stand at&nbsp;the mid-way point in&nbsp;this journey (that’s right, it’s not the end, for this road goes on&nbsp;forever) will exceed your expectations. By&nbsp;carrying out these things (which are really very simple!) every day and working them into your life, you’ll begin to&nbsp;feel a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;harmony and omnipotence; you’ll start to&nbsp;see the light at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the tunnel. Yes, it&nbsp;sounds a&nbsp;bit pretentious...but believe&nbsp;me, it’s true."</p><p>Author: Svetlana Pokrevskaya<br>Photo credit: Jean-François Jonvelle</p><p>Preview photo credit Jean-François Jonvelle</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ytpmabmJa7qLGMsqauql2htqexjJ%2Bmq2WknbJursStq56qXZ67brbUrKtmp56aeq67za2fZm1ganw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./parenting-good-parts-happiness.html>&#171;&nbsp;I Wish More People Talked About the Good Parts of Parenting</a>
