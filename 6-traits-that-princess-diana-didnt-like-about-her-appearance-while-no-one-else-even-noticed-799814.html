But in&nbsp;real life, even princesses are not perfect. The crown and their high status don’t protect them from self-destructive thoughts about their appearance (like if&nbsp;someone calls them too curvy or&nbsp;too slim, too tall or&nbsp;too short). Similar complexes were even eating away at&nbsp;the British princess Diana, one of&nbsp;the most famous women on&nbsp;Earth who was loved by&nbsp;the whole world.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> dove into Diana’s biography and now we&nbsp;know that princesses are just like the rest of&nbsp;us when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;insecurities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e1/876/da660a58018ad136a84f4105f1.jpg><p>After Diana passed away, more than a&nbsp;<a href=#>million</a> people gathered in&nbsp;London along the route of&nbsp;the funeral procession. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed that Diana was the most popular member of&nbsp;the British royal family in&nbsp;Great Britain.</p><p>Though the princess was an&nbsp;icon of&nbsp;style, she was also a&nbsp;person full of&nbsp;complexes at&nbsp;the same time. For example, when the artist Israel Zohar <a href=#>painted</a> her portrait in&nbsp;1990, Diana was constantly asking him to&nbsp;correct something about her appearance in&nbsp;the painting, <strong>especially when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;her nose.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/182/e45/dd402858f598deb27c293e1cfa.jpg><p>The princess’s big nose was actively discussed by&nbsp;the <a href=#>press</a>. <strong>Diana tried to&nbsp;<a href=#>hide</a> it&nbsp;with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;big hairdo, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;resorting to&nbsp;a&nbsp;special pose in&nbsp;all of&nbsp;her photos</strong>. She would bend her head slightly down, turn it&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit to&nbsp;the side, and lift her eyes. This became her signature angle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1eb/ea6/5a5270540cafef481601d830d1.jpg><p>In&nbsp;addition, a&nbsp;slightly lowered head helped Diana cope with another complex: <strong>she <a href=#>was ashamed</a> of&nbsp;her height</strong> (5&nbsp;ft 8&nbsp;in). Her insecurity about her <a href=#>height</a> was fueled by&nbsp;the fact that her husband’s height was the same.</p><p>However, in&nbsp;official portraits, the princess appears to&nbsp;be&nbsp;shorter than her husband because the court photographers intentionally made Diana look shorter&nbsp;— she was put in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;her spouse and was told to&nbsp;wear flat shoes. This helped Charles look taller and more impressive than his wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/43e/3d5/f6e2855d78b1ece55ba2fe79cc.jpg><p><strong>Due to&nbsp;the <a href=#>embarrassment</a> about her height, the princess had problems with her posture.</strong> Diana was slouched and bent her shoulders forward. <a href=#>According</a> to&nbsp;her doctor, the situation was aggravated by&nbsp;the fact that she had a&nbsp;curvature of&nbsp;the spine.</p><p>Also, Diana would often keep her <a href=#>head</a> down when she was talking to&nbsp;people so&nbsp;that the communication was comfortable for whoever she was speaking to&nbsp;and so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;didn’t seem to&nbsp;them that she was looking down at&nbsp;them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f43/285/43158f5c23842e0dc5f3288711.jpg><p>There is&nbsp;another complex that tortured Diana. <strong>She considered herself fat</strong>. It&nbsp;was all because of&nbsp;an&nbsp;accidental phrase Prince Charles said to&nbsp;his young bride, having put his hand on&nbsp;her waist, “Oh, a&nbsp;bit chubby here, aren’t we?” And she took her groom’s words painfully.</p><p>That’s why this 19-year-old girl started to&nbsp;<a href=#>lose weight</a> rapidly before her wedding day. When courtyard tailors started to&nbsp;sew a&nbsp;wedding dress for Diana, her waist was 30&nbsp;inches. Before the wedding ceremony, the princess’s waist was reduced to&nbsp;23&nbsp;inches. One of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> designers <a href=#>recalls</a> that Diana was so&nbsp;slim, you could actually see the bones in&nbsp;her face.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d8/4e2/6b0a9956c9b6a826051ff6d6e1.jpg><p>One week after the wedding, <strong>Diana started to&nbsp;suffer from <a href=#>bulimia</a>, which <a href=#>lasted</a> for about <a href=#>10&nbsp;years</a></strong>. Diana shared that there were several reasons for this nervous disorder. First and foremost, she had issues with her husband. They were supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;together and to&nbsp;portray a&nbsp;good relationship in&nbsp;public, but in&nbsp;fact, there was no&nbsp;peace and harmony between them.</p><p>Second, one of&nbsp;the princess’s duties was to&nbsp;communicate with severely ill people, which turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;serious blow to&nbsp;her <a href=# title=psyche data-link=tag>psyche</a>. Diana didn’t seek help for her bulimia because she was ashamed of&nbsp;her disorder and hated herself for&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c59/1b1/16c5b559f987292dc2cccec887.jpg><p>The beautiful <strong>Diana also believed that she had a&nbsp;swimmer’s physique</strong>. She disliked her big shoulders. Fortunately, looks with voluminous shoulders were trendy in&nbsp;the ’80s. Diana skillfully used this trend, opting for outfits with shoulder pads and clothing styles that were relevant for those times. In&nbsp;this way, Diana’s shoulders didn’t look big and it&nbsp;created an&nbsp;impression as&nbsp;if&nbsp;the princess was just following fashion trends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ff/094/bd3a99585b80f3e744eca79abf.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;Carolan Brown, Diana’s personal trainer, after having given birth to&nbsp;2&nbsp;kids, <strong>the princess’s <a href=#>belly</a> required a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;attention and physical activity</strong>. The princess was actively engaged in&nbsp;sports which helped her to&nbsp;not only improve her body, but also her emotional condition.</p><p>Also, Carolan recalls that Diana became interested in&nbsp;<a href=#>voice-building</a> lessons because she thought that her voice didn’t sound confident enough and sounded like a&nbsp;little girl’s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e21/7f6/2acdc2599eb0c9861404530019.jpg><p>This photo, where she is&nbsp;wearing a&nbsp;black dress, was taken on&nbsp;the day that Prince Charles declared in&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV interview that he&nbsp;was having an&nbsp;affair with another woman. Afterward, Diana started to&nbsp;openly speak on&nbsp;television about how difficult the recent past years had been for her. <strong>Prior to&nbsp;that, Diana hadn’t confessed in&nbsp;public that she had psychological problems.</strong></p><p>Family life with Charles didn’t work out, but it&nbsp;was necessary for them to&nbsp;show a&nbsp;happy marriage. For many years, Diana didn’t feel <a href=#>support</a> from the royal family and had a&nbsp;difficult relationship with her own mother. So&nbsp;<strong>the young princess became a&nbsp;hostage to&nbsp;<a href=#>depression</a>.</strong></p><p>But she found strength and started to&nbsp;gradually get rid of&nbsp;the insecurities and nervous tension that had continued to&nbsp;poison her life for many years. She fought her bulimia and started to&nbsp;regularly workout at&nbsp;the gym. <strong>She no&nbsp;longer had to&nbsp;pretend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving wife in&nbsp;public.</strong></p><p>Complexes about appearance and low self-confidence can happen to&nbsp;anyone, even to&nbsp;the members of&nbsp;the royal family. The main thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;find enough strength to&nbsp;fight them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZINuwNGaoK2rXam1osCMqamippOawLR5w6KYp5ldmbalutNmo6KjlWKuo7vUrWShnaJirrG8xJqpmqaTmnq4tMilnGamn2K8r7GMnqOsnV2aw6a6jKemraGTmrFug5hyb2psXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./santa-claus-soviet-history.html>&#171;&nbsp;History of Santa Claus in Soviet Russia From Exile to Return</a>
