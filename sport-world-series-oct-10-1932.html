Lou Gehrig, the New York Yankees’ first baseman since 1925. is a heavyset, stolid young man and one of the few professional baseballers who plays on a home town team. His Teutonic mother & father were caretakers at a Columbia fraternity house. Son Lou went to Columbia, played on the ball team, signed a contract with the Yankees. Babe Ruth coached him in batting: in a year or two Gehrig was, next to Ruth, the hardest hitter in the most potent batting machine baseball had ever know:n. In 1927, Gehrig was voted most valuable player in the American League. He batted in nine runs in the 1928 World Series (a record): he tied Babe Ruth’s record of hitting four homers in a World Series the same year; last summer he set a record by making four consecutive homeruns in one game (against Philadelphia). He has not missed a game for seven seasons. Last week, Lou Gehrig went to bat in the first game of the World Series between the Chicago Cubs and the New York Yankees, for the second time, in the fourth inning.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The score was 2 to 0 for Chicago. Side-whiskered Guy Bush, who looks like a nervous villain in a melodrama, had been through the Yankee line-up once, pitching carefully, without allowing a hit. At the start of the fourth. Bush walked Combs. made Scwell ground out, frowned darkly when Ruth hit a whistling single to right. Gehrig, stamping his feet on the caked dust, waited till the count was two balls and two strikes. His bat met the next pitch, a Bush screwball, squarely. The ball traveled into the screaming right field bleachers for a homerun.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It was the hit that won the game. A villain foiled, Pitcher Bush went completely to pieces in the sixth, when he walked four batters. He was replaced by Spitballer Burleigh Grimes, who worked for St. Louis in last year’s Series. By the time the sloppy inning was over. New York had five runs on two hits and no Chicago errors. The Cubs got four runs in the last three innings, but so did the Yankees. New York 12, Chicago 6.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Second Game was a well-pitched battle between 23-year-old Lon Warneke of the Cubs, who won more games (22) in his first big league season than any other National League pitcher, and 22-year-old Vernon (“Goofy”) Gomez, tall, lean, left-handed Yankee, who comes from Rodeo, Calif. Chicago got one run in the first, the Yankees two. When his teammates had tied the score in the third, Warneke walked Ruth and let Gehrig single. Then, to fill the bases for a force play, he walked Dickey. It was sound strategy but it did not work. Chapman, next batter, smashed the first pitch for a sharp single to right. scoring two runs. Warneke was steady after that, except for a few moments in the fifth, but Gomez was steadier. Score for the game was New York 5, Chicago 2. Score for the pitchers: Gomez, 8 strikeouts. 9 hits, i walk; Warneke. 7 strikeouts. 10 hits. 4 walks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Third Game. It was the fifth inning of the most dramatic game in the series. In the first, hulking Babe Ruth had knocked a homerun into the temporary bleachers beyond the right field fence, scoring three runs. In the third, Gehrig had hit his second homerun of the series for the Yankees’ fourth run. Meanwhile the Cubs had caught up, with a run in the first, two in the third when Kiki Cuyler drove a homerun into the right field bleachers, another in the fourth when Jurges scored on Lazzeri’s fumble. Now, with the score tied. Babe Ruth, whom Pitcher Root had been ordered not to pass, arrived at the plate with three big bats over his shoulder.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The first ball was a strike. The crowd squealed happily. Fat and cocky, Ruth faced the grandstand and held up one finger. After throwing two balls. Pitcher Root got over another strike. This time the players in the Cubs’ dugout peered and chuckled. Still cocky, Ruth held up two fingers. The next pitch broke over the corner of the plate. Ruth swung at it. There was a crack. Centerfielder Johnny Moore started to run; then he stood still and watched the ball, a dwindling white spot against the blue sky, clear the ware fence and drop 436 ft. from the plate, one of the longest homeruns on record. Babe Ruth shambled slowly around the bases, shaking his fat shoulders and making remarks of mockery to each infielder as he passed. In the uproar, no one was paying much attention to what happened next. Lou Gehrig came to bat and hit the first pitch to the right field flag post. This was a homerun also.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The game was as good as over. Pitcher Root was withdrawn and three other Cubs who followed himâ€”Malone, May. Tinningâ€”managed to hold the Yankees down to one more run. The Cubs threatened in the ninth when Gabby Hartnett opened the inning with a homer into the left-field bleachers but Manager McCarthy of the Yankees withdrew Pipgras. sent in Herb Pennock, who played in his first World Series in 1914 and had never lost a World Series game since. Pennock made short work of the next three batters. Score: New York 7, Chicago 5.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fourth Game, Colonel Jacob Ruppert, the 65-year-old bon vivant who owns the Yankees, cannot bear his team to lose, cannot bear to watch a close game, let alone a close World Series. Even to win in four straight games is too close for him until the fourth game is won. He begged his men to win last Sunday and end his terrible suspense. The Yankees obliged with all the trimmings.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Chicago had torn Col. Ruppert’s heartstrings with four runs in the first inning off young pitcher Johnny Allen. After that the rumble and crash of Yankee bats made 17 hits, discouraged four Chicago pitchers. In the first, the side-whiskered Bush was knocked out of the box; in the third. Lazzeri smashed a homerun over the right field bleacher screen scoring two runs; in the sixth. Gehrig singled for two runs; in the seventh five hits made four more runs; and in the ninth, when the Yankees were four runs ahead, they made four more, two on Lazzeri’s second homerun. Score: New York 13, Chicago 6.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Little World Series, In Minneapolis, Col. Ruppert’s Newark Bears, pennant winners in the International League, drew even in the Little World Series by winning the fourth game, 5 to 2, against theMinneapolis Millers, American Association pennant winners. The day before, four trunks containing Bear uniforms and equipment were pushed off the Bears’ train by one W. J. Chipman, who was riding illegally in the baggage car and said he needed more room.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ubmhhZoNwv8%2Boqa1lp6S%2FrbCMrJyroZWoerCv02ZoaWVhboBzew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kevin-spacey-why-european-awards-italy-uk-1236072901.html>&#171;&nbsp;Why Is Kevin Spacey Suddenly Being Honored With Awards in Europe?</a>
