But over the past nine years, legendary Nigerian rapper, <strong>Olamide </strong>has endorsed certain acts with his co-sign and other times, he's signed them.</p><p>Olamide and his label, YBNL have contributed to some of the biggest music careers in recent Nigerian history. While some have since left him in acrimony, most retain respect for him. When his 10th studio project, <strong>999 EP </strong>was announced on February 9, 2020, <strong>Adekunle Gold </strong>and <strong>Fireboy, </strong>two artists he's helped announced the album on Twitter NG.</p><p>The album which has 9 tracks will feature <strong>Phyno, Rhatti, Show, Cheque, Jayboi, Sosa-E and Jackwillz. </strong>Incidentally, it will be Olamide's 10th studio album. Production is handled by <strong>Olamide, Cracker Mallo, Pheelz, Eskeez </strong>and <strong>ID Cabasa. </strong>The album is mixed and mastered by budding engineer, <strong>STG.</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In 2010, Nigerian rap superstar, Olamide Adedeji also known as Olamide Badoo launched onto the the scene with his monster hit single, 'Eni Duro.' At the time, he was signed to ID Cabasa's record label, <strong>Coded Tunes Records </strong>alongside <strong>Seriki </strong>and <strong>Kayefi.</strong> Under the label, he released his first album, <strong>Rapsodi.</strong></p><p>The terms of his exit were amicable. Olamide then branched out and founded his own record label, <strong>YBNL Nation</strong> (Y.B.N.L is an acronym for Yahoo Boy No Laptop, a tribute to how much money he makes) under which he released his subsequent albums.</p><p><strong>999 EP</strong> drops at 9pm tonight - February 10, 2019. Pulse takes a trip down memory lane to highlight the top 10 acts that Olamide has aided through record deals or co-signs.

Signed almost at the same time as Chinko Ekun, the Plateau State-born artist released two singles, 'TTYL' and 'Nakam' on the label before exiting in acrimonious circumstances per 2016.</p><p>Upon his exit from the label, the singer gave an exclusive interview to Showtime where he took swipes at Olamide, "YBNL management and other labels in Nigeria need to adopt an entrepreneurial system that focuses on artiste development because there is zero fan base in Nigeria.</p><p>"Beyonce’s husband, Jayz, is an undisputed boss because he understands this concept and creates acts that last to create others too.</p><p>“I’m engaging in other money-making options, music is just an option and one that I love very much; I never asked to be signed on to YBNL, so I’m not bothered as much. But for the sake of those who dig my songs I’m coming with something soon, something cooking with Kiddominant is dropping soon.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Nonetheless, he attempted some conciliation in 2017 by attempting to mend fences with the label and Olamide.</p><p>He wrote on his Instagram page that, "Mood, feeling like Baddo right now, I want to take this time out to apologize, first to @baddosneh for the rash things I said last year.</p><p>"I was bitter over how things took a turn, I guess I owe all of you an apology and I humbly ask that you guys overlook what I said and see me for who I really am, a happy, fun-loving and jonzing pretty boy. I also apologize to the whole YBNL team and take responsibility for my words.</p><p>I love @baddosneh as a big bro and how creative he has inspired me to want to be better. I guess I was really missing the crew; I love you guys. Thanks for not judging me and taking time out to read this.

One morning, his freestyle to smash hit, 'Able God' went viral on <strong>Twitter</strong>.</p><p>One reason for that were his bars, cadences and flows - crisp and impressive. Another reason was the supposed young 'cameraman' who pouted at camera like a - 'slay queen' at <strong>Silverbird Galleria</strong>'s toilet in 2010 - throughout the duration of <strong>Picazo</strong>'s freestyle. He got clowned on social media as the video waxed in viewership.</p><p>It was almost like he knew the video would go viral. <strong>Picazo </strong>was featured on the <a href=# id=fb413145-9a32-48a9-a1d3-2809ec6bca05 data-link-role-code=none>YBNL Mafia Family </a>album and things changed.

He arrived at YBNL a little before Picazo, Yomi Blaize and Fireboy DML.</p><p>But after the rumblings of his YBNL exit from YBNL earlier in the year, he finally jumped on <strong>Naijaloaded TV </strong>to confirm the end of his mixed affiliation with YBNL. During the interview, he claimed that though he was paid between 50,000 and 80,000 for shows, he never had a written contract with the label.</p><p>He said, “I don’t have any deal with YBNL or Olamide.

On his own, he released singles like 'King' and 'Sing' alongside <strong>Oxlade. </strong>But then came December 2018, <strong>Olamide </strong>released a collaboration album with his signees.

In 2013, <strong>Olamide </strong>released his album, <strong>Baddest Guy Ever Liveth </strong>and most of its songs were produced by the then-Pheelz Mr Producer. On the album, track three is titled 'Rep Adugbo' and it features <strong>Pheelz </strong>as an artist alongside <strong>Buckwyla.</strong></p><p>Again, Pheelz is no artist but Olamide has been his vessel to success in Nigerian music - it all started with that moment.. For the 2010s, <strong>Pulse </strong>named him as second best producer of the decade.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mrKyhk2Szqr7Em6ayZZyuwaJ5wJ2cpK2eobJus86lm2ZpYGKus8DIrKusZaedvG6uy56uZqyYp7y2s8dmpqWZnZ6xpnnAp5tmsZKjuXB%2Fj6ClbZqm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./history-was-made-meet-the-first-transgender-woman-to-win-miss-portugal-815751.html>&#171;&nbsp;History Was Made: Meet the First Transgender Woman to Win Miss Portugal</a>
