These are the questions which bother many fans of boxing. We will answer them below and will tell you about the top facts about the boxing legend.</p><h2>George Foreman net worth and bio</h2><p class=align-left><a id=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Foreman href=# rel="nofollow noopener">George Edward Foreman</a> was born on January 10, 1949, in Marshall, Texas. So this year the retired boxer turned 70 years old. His biological father, Leroy Moorhead, died after his birth. George had six brothers and sisters, so the family lived in poverty. At the age of 15, the boy was expelled from school. He often offended other children, participating in wars between street gangs.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/927bdcacf8db8f60.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lil Baby net worth: how has the rapper earned all his riches?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Fortunately for him, the young man joined the Job Corps, in which people were taught different types of work and sports. As a part of this program, the future star went to California, where he met Doc Broadus, who was an adviser to the working corps, as well as a boxing trainer. Thus, in addition to the work of a carpenter, the teenager learned to box.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Kobe Bryant net worth, endorsements, sponsors, salary and career earnings</p><p class=align-left>Starting training, he quickly achieved incredible success on the amateur ring.

Knockouts followed one after the other. Famous fighters, who until that moment were considered unconquerable, were among the defeated by Big George. In 1969, he ended the fight with Chuck Wepner with a knockout, a year later — with George Chuvalo, and in 1973 he defeated Jose Roman and Joe Frazier.</p><p class=align-left>His fight with Muhammad Ali went down in history as "The Rumble in the Jungle." It took place in 1974. The advantages of George Foreman were the onslaught and youth. Before the battle, he well studied the tactics of Muhammad Ali. In the first round, he tried to press him against the ropes and not let him move, holding down powerful punches to the hull. Ali held out against Foreman, and in the eighth round, he managed to knock him out. It was his first shutout as a professional boxer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bcd42e1b245cca37.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Everything you need to know about Tony Robbins net worth and his expensive houses</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The boxer left the ring in 1977 after being defeated by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jimmy Young</a>, but this was not the end of his sports career. Ten years later, Foreman returned on the ring. 1987 can be called a turning point in the boxer's biography — then he made a difficult decision to return to the professional ring. Victories in the ring followed one after the other. In 1994, the boxer managed to regain the title of champion, after he had defeated Michael Moorer.
